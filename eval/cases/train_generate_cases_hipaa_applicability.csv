In response to that motion, President Clinton filed a motion for leave to intervene in his personal capacity.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"On April 10, 2009, Lieutenant Todd Palmer of the Lawton Police Department received a tip from a reliable informant that a black male would be bringing crack cocaine into Lawton from Texas in a small red pickup. The informant gave Palmer the area of town and the time of day to look for the vehicle. Palmer and his partner were in the area at the given time and saw a red pickup. Palmer observed that its paper license tag, which the truck had in place of a license plate, was unlawfully covered in plastic. Because Palmer and his partner were in an unmarked car, Palmer requested that a patrol unit stop the truck.Officer Timothy Poff received Palmer’s radio request, although he was not provided any details regarding the grounds for the stop. As Poff followed the red pickup into a residential area, he noticed that the license tag looked altered or wrinkled; it was harder to read the number than it usually is on an Oklahoma paper tag. He did not notice that the tag was covered in plastic, but thought that its weathered appearance meant that it had been on the car for longer than 30 days, the amount of time for which paper tags are valid. He could not read the tag’s expiration date from his position about a car-length behind the truck because the expiration date was much smaller than normal for a paper tag. Poff turned on his emergency lights and pulled the truck over.Once the truck came to a stop, Poff saw the driver, Defendant, reaching for something by the center console inside the truck. Because he knew that Palmer generally targeted violent drug offenders, Poff was concerned for his safety and decided to deal with Defendant before examining the tag further. He obtained Defendant’s driver’s license and returned to his car to check it.About two minutes after Poffs initial contact with Defendant, before he had even returned to his squad car, a canine unit arrived. The dog alerted on the truck. Defendant was asked to get out of his vehicle, but while he was being patted down, he attempted to escape. After he was caught, a search of the truck revealed 25 grams of crack cocaine.At the evidentiary hearing on Defendant’s motion to suppress, the district court ruled that the stop and search were lawful. Defendant was convicted in a bench trial on stipulated facts. He appeals the denial of his suppression motion.","{'Sender': 'Reliable informant', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Lieutenant Todd Palmer', 'Recipient Role': 'Law enforcement officer', 'About': 'Black male suspected of bringing crack cocaine into Lawton', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Suspected criminal activity', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': ""The informant's tip is reliable""}"

Petitioner asserts the following bases for quashing the summons: (1) the summons violates petitioner’s Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures; (2) the IRS lacks the requisite jurisdiction over the records requested; (3) the IRS issued the summons in bad faith by failing to comply with the disclosure requirements in 26 U.S.C. § 7521(b) and in the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(3)(A)-(D); (4) the IRS acted in bad faith by failing to follow its internal regulations regarding the legitimacy of business trusts; (5) the IRS acted in bad faith by using the summons to gather evidence in connection with a future criminal prosecution against petitioner; and (6) the IRS lacks the authority to send the summons to Security Mutual because it is not a “third-party reeordkeeper,” as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 7609(a)(3). Respondent cross-moves for summary denial of the petition to quash the summons, and to enforce the summons.","{'Sender': 'IRS', 'Sender Role': 'Government Agency', 'Recipient': 'Security Mutual', 'Recipient Role': 'Financial Institution', 'About': 'Bruce B.

This Court bifurcated the litigation into two phases, the first of which primarily addressed “referral agency” documents requested by plaintiff, and the second of which primarily considered the documents in four FBI “Internal Security Files.” At the conclusion of the first phase, this Court granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment with respect to all documents withheld or redacted under FOIA exemptions 1, 2, 3, and 5, and some documents withheld or redacted under exemption 7. Billington v. Dep’t of Justice, 11 F.Supp.2d 45, 75 (D.D.C.1998) (“Billington I ”). Defendant was also ordered to submit a supplemental affidavit describing with specificity the contents of several documents withheld under exemption 7(D), and explaining why these documents were withheld. Id. Finally, this Court ordered defendant to submit a State Department document withheld under exemption 6 for in camera review by this Court.

It granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment with respect to documents in the “Internal Security Files” that had been withheld under exemptions 1, 2, 7(C), and 7(D). Id. The Court also granted summary judgment for defendant on plaintiffs remaining claims concerning the “referral agency” documents. Id. Plaintiff appealed both decisions of this Court.The D.C. Circuit reversed this Court’s grant of summary judgment regarding documents withheld under exemption 7(D), and remanded to permit the government to “make a stronger showing” of its reasons for withholding the documents. Billington III, 233 F.3d at 585. In addition, the D.C. Circuit found that declarations submitted by the State Department and the Internal Revenue Service lacked a sufficient segregability' analysis. It remanded to this Court for findings regarding the segregability of withholdings from two documents by the Internal Revenue Service, and from two documents by the State Department. Finally, the D.C. Circuit required this Court to determine the applicability of exemption 6 to the two State Department documents and decide whether any non-exempt portions of the documents should be released.On November 28, 2001, defendant submitted the four documents at issue for in camera review.

Among the persons gathered was appellant Thomas, who was carrying a brown gym bag. At the sight of the police, the group moved hurriedly inside the apartment house entrance. One of the police officers, Kenneth N. Jones, ran to the front door of the building and peered through a diamond-shaped window that allowed him to see the entryway and the staircase leading directly from the door to the second floor. The officer saw Thomas on the second floor landing crouched over his gym bag. According to Officer Jones’ testimony, Thomas placed the bag in front of an apartment door on the second floor. Thomas then began down the stairway, leaving the bag in front of the door. At that moment, Officer Jones opened the door and ordered Thomas and the other individuals out of the building.After the group, including Thomas, had moved outside, Officer Jones entered the public hallway of the building, mounted the stairs to the second floor, and retrieved the bag that Thomas had left there. He took the bag down the stairs and out of the building. Without asking for permission, Officer Jones opened the bag and found that it contained a 20-gauge sawed-off shotgun, a 9-millimeter semi-automatic weapon, and live rounds of ammunition. The gym bag also contained 23 bags of a substance that field-tested positive for cocaine. In addition, the bag held personal effects, including a video club membership card with Thomas’ name on it.In a three-count indictment, Thomas was charged with possessing five grams or more of cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a), (b)(1)(B)(ii), carrying a short-barreled shotgun and semi-automatic pistol during a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), and possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(d), 5871.

See 15 U.S.C. § 1681b. All Plaintiffs allege that Ocwen obtained their credit reports under false pretenses or knowingly without a permissible purpose, each willful violations under the statute. See §§ 1681n & 1681q.Marino alleges that he discharged a mortgage loan that had been serviced by Defendant in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. {Mar-ino, ECF No. 1 at 3.) After his relationship with Defendant ended, Marino did not seek credit of any type from Defendant, Defendant knew of the discharge of the loan, and Defendant obtained information from a CRA twice about Marino without his authorization. {Id.)

Immediately after the verdict had been issued, two jurors alleged that a third juror had disobeyed the court’s admonition by seeking out television coverage online. The Commonwealth moved for a mistrial based on these allegations. Instead, the judge questioned the third juror about the accusation in open court, and that juror denied any wrongdoing. No other evidence was presented. The judge then ruled that any alleged juror misconduct did not impact the verdict, and denied the Commonwealth’s motion for a mistrial.The trial court subsequently issued subpoenas for the three jurors, two accusers and one accused, to appear on May 10, 2010 for a “contempt of court” hearing. When they arrived, the judge took the jurors into chambers and asked each to state his position. The accused juror was not represented by counsel, and was not allowed to cross-examine the two accusers. Excluded from this hearing were the Commonwealth’s Attorney and Appellant Riley, a reporter from the Courier-Journal, both of whom objected to their exclusion.Following the hearing, the trial court determined that there was insufficient evidence to find the accused juror to be in contempt of court, and again allowed the verdict to stand. At this point, Appellants restated in writing their objection to the closure of the hearing and moved for immediate release of a recording of the hearing. The court granted this motion and the recording of the hearing was released.Dissatisfied by this result, Appellants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition against Judge Gibson’s closure of the hearing.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Among the records Oguaju received was the plea agreement of David Powell, an escaped convict who was to testify against Oguaju in return for a recommendation of leniency from the prosecutor in his trial for escape.After Oguaju was convicted he asked the Marshals Service to give him, pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, “[a]ny and all information in [its] file that deals directly or indirectly with David Powell ... including] investigative reports of Mr. Powell’s escape from prison.” Oguaju wrote:Disclosure of the requested information to me is in [the] public interest, as it is likely to contribute significantly to the clarification of Constitutional and/or legal issues.

The Department of Justice denied the appeal on the ground that, absent “an overriding public interest, even to acknowledge the existence of’ the records would unjustifiably invade Powell’s privacy.Oguaju then petitioned for review by the district court, which granted summary judgment to the Marshals Service.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"{2} The material facts are undisputed. On June 19, 2000, Defendant was stopped for not wearing a seatbelt. The officer who stopped him issued a citation and ran a standard check to see if Defendant had any outstanding warrants. The check revealed that Defendant had an outstanding municipal court warrant for failure to appear. Because the officer planned to arrest Defendant, he called for backup, partly since there was a passenger in the car and also since it was standard procedure to call for backup before arresting anyone. When the backup officer arrived, the original officer took Defendant out of the car and arrested him. After Defendant was handcuffed, the officer asked Defendant if he had anything in his pockets that he wished to leave in his car before being taken to jail. The officer also asked Defendant if he wanted the passenger, who was also outside the car by this point, to take the car. Defendant told the officer that he could pull everything out of Defendant’s pockets, and he gave permission for the passenger to take the car. One of the items the officer removed from Defendant’s pockets was a bulky black pouch, which Defendant said contained ammunition.{3} The officer then asked Defendant if he had a gun on him, and Defendant told him that he did not but that the officer could find a gun in the front door pocket of the car on the driver’s side. The officer testified that the passenger at that point was closer to the ear than he was, that he had safety concerns, and that he retrieved the gun, a loaded automatic weapon, and took it to his car to run a check on it to see if it was stolen. Although Defendant told the officer it was his gun, the officer testified that he could not turn the gun over until he found out whether Defendant owned the gun. The officer also testified that for safety reasons, once he encounters a weapon, it is his standard procedure to check the weapon through the NCIC database. The check revealed that the weapon was stolen, and a further check revealed that Defendant was a convicted felon. Defendant was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. He subsequently moved to suppress the gun. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant entered a conditional guilty plea and reserved his right to appeal the denial of the suppression motion.","{'Sender': 'Police officer', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement', 'Recipient': 'Defendant', 'Recipient Role': 'Suspect', 'About': 'Defendant', 'About Role': 'Suspect', 'Type': 'Private information (possession of a firearm)', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Sonya Stewart, an employee at the Department of Commerce, alleges that Frank DeGeorge, when he was Inspector General of the Department, berated her with a tirade of profanity in a telephone conversation on May 3, 1996. Stewart reported the incident to an equal employment opportunity counselor within the Department and eventually filed a formal complaint. Thereafter the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigated the situation, and the Department ultimately notified Stewart that her claim had been rejected.According to Stewart, between the time she first reported the incident and the time she received the Department’s final decision, the Acting General Counsel of the Department, Sue Esserman; the Assistant General Counsel for Administration, Barbara Fredericks; and the Chief of the Employment Law Division, Kathleen Taylor, all engaged in various acts of retaliation against her. Stewart also claims to have kept detailed notes about the initial incident and the acts of retaliation, including notes about “strategies for pursuing her claim.” Stewart says she initially kept these notes and related documents in her office at the Department but later agreed to give them to John Sopko, Chief Counsel of the Special Matters Unit, to be kept in part in a safe and in part in a locked cabinet. Stewart claims she agreed to give Sopko the documents only upon being assured that no one, including specifically Fredericks and Taylor, would see them. Fredericks and Taylor knew about this arrangement but nonetheless reviewed the files while Stewart was on sick leave in August, 1998.In February, 2000 Stewart sued the Department under Title VII for the abusive comments and the retaliation, and sued Fredericks and Taylor under the Fourth Amendment for reading her private papers. The district court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims. The court reasoned that the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 2301-2805, which established a system of administrative remedies for improper actions by supervisors in the federal workplace, precludes Stewart from recovering under the Fourth Amendment for the allegedly illegal search.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Late one evening, Rockbridge County Police Officer Hugh Bolen stopped Reittinger’s van when Bolen observed it being driven with an inoperable headlight. After giving Reittinger a verbal warning to have the headlight repaired, Bolen told Reittinger he was “free to go.” Immediately thereafter, Bolen asked Reittinger if he had contraband, or drugs, or firearms in the vehicle. Reittinger eventually responded “no, that there wasn’t anything illegal in the vehicle.” Bolen then asked if he could search the vehicle for weapons or drugs. Reittinger “turned around in his seat and looked at his passenger[s] and . ■.. whispered something.” Bolen repeated the question several times. Reittinger remained silent but, eventually, without being requested to do so, exited the vehicle. Bolen testified that he did not have any particular reason to suspect that Reittinger was engaged in criminal activity.As Reittinger alighted from the vehicle, Bolen observed a bulge in Reittinger’s front pocket. Bolen then frisked Reittinger’s outer clothing because he felt it was “a safety issue, out there in the dark.” Bolen felt a large, hard bulge in Reittinger’s pocket, which he believed might have been a weapon. Bolen asked Reittinger what was causing the bulge. Reittinger did not answer and “tried to cover [the pocket] up.” After Bolen told Reittinger, “you need to bring that out of your pocket,” Reittinger pulled out a smoking device that contained marijuana residue. Reittinger was charged with possession of marijuana.At trial, Reittinger filed a motion to suppress the marijuana evidence on the ground that Bolen had seized it in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court ruled that Bolen’s requesting consent to search the van immediately after investigating the equipment violation and telling Reittinger he was “free to go” would have led a reasonable person to believe he or she was being further detained and was not free to leave. Thus, the trial court ruled that Bolen had illegally detained Reittinger without a reasonable, articulable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity. The trial court found that Reittinger exited the van without being asked to do so, in a rural setting, at night, and after Bolen had asked for permission to search the van. The trial court further found that although Reittinger consented to the search of the van “[i]t is not exactly clear whether [Reittinger] finally consented to [the] search after he exited the van and before the pat down or after the pat down.” Thus, the court made no finding of fact that Reittinger had consented to his van being searched when Officer Bolen frisked him for weapons. Based on these findings, the court ruled that, although Bolen unlawfully detained Reittinger after the initial investigation, Bolen articulated a reason to suspect that Reittinger was armed and dangerous and, thus, that Bolen was justified in frisking Reittinger for the officer’s own safety. The court denied Reittinger’s motion to suppress and convicted him for possession of marijuana.","{'Sender': 'Police Officer Hugh Bolen', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement officer', 'Recipient': 'Reittinger', 'Recipient Role': 'Driver of the van', 'About': 'Marijuana possession', 'About Role': 'Reittinger', 'Type': 'Verbal communication and physical search', 'Purpose': 'Investigation of potential criminal activity', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Reittinger (unclear if consent was given for search)', 'Belief': 'Officer Bolen did not have a particular reason to suspect Reittinger was engaged in criminal activity, but based on the circumstances, he had reason to suspect Reittinger was armed and dangerous and justified in frisking him for safety reasons.'}"

At Oguaju’s request, the court ordered the Government to turn over to the defense any exculpatory information it had, as required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Among the records Oguaju received was the plea agreement of David Powell, an escaped convict who was to testify against Oguaju in return for a recommendation of leniency from the prosecutor in his trial for escape.After Oguaju was convicted he asked the Marshals Service to give him, pursuant to the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, “[a]ny and all information in [its] file that deals directly or indirectly with David Powell ... including] investigative reports of Mr. Powell’s escape from prison.” Oguaju wrote:Disclosure of the requested information to me is in [the] public interest, as it is likely to contribute significantly to the clarification of Constitutional and/or legal issues. The information requested is for personal use and will aid me to disclose/corroborate fraud committed by [Powell], the information will not be used for any commercial purposes.The Marshals Service first made a “Glomar response” — refusing to confirm or to deny the existence of any records, see Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009 (D.C.Cir. 1976) — and then went on to assert that the records, if they exist, “would be exempt from disclosure pursuant to exemption 7(C) of the Freedom of Information Act.” That exemption permits an agency to withhold “information compiled for law enforcement purposes” when producing that information “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).Oguaju filed an administrative appeal in which he asserted that the “documents requested [are] material to the preparation of [his] defense brief on appeal” because the “[p]rosecutor improperly withheld agency record[s]” that would reveal Powell had perjured himself when he testified against Oguaju. The Department of Justice denied the appeal on the ground that, absent “an overriding public interest, even to acknowledge the existence of’ the records would unjustifiably invade Powell’s privacy.Oguaju then petitioned for review by the district court, which granted summary judgment to the Marshals Sendee.

Wilder submitted a personal injury claim, and Grange assigned Erica Barnes (“Barnes”) to serve as the adjuster on the claim. After negotiating with Grange for six months, Wilder was dissatisfied with the way the claim was being handled and he filed suit in the Owsley Circuit Court. Wilder’s lawsuit included a personal injury claim against Sid Gabbard and a bad faith claim against Grange.The trial court bifurcated the claims, holding the bad faith claim in abeyance until after the trial on the personal injury claim. At the conclusion of the trial of the personal injury claim, the jury returned a verdict for Wilder and awarded him approximately $26,000.00.The bad faith claim alleges that Barnes undervalued Wilder’s claim during negotiations and that she had repeatedly delayed communicating with Wilder’s attorney. During pretrial preparations, Wilder submitted forty-two discovery requests to Grange. Grange objected to sixteen of those requests, citing concerns about relevancy, privacy, improper motive, trade secret privileges, and the burdensome nature of the requests. The trial court overruled Grange’s objections and granted Wilder’s motion to compel the discovery. Grange then requested a protective order to limit the discovery allowed, or in the alternative, to prohibit public disclosure of the discovery. The trial court deified the motion without making any findings of fact. Grange again requested a protective order, specifically asking the trial court to conduct an in camera review of the materials to be produced to determine the extent of relevancy and privilege, and again in the alternative, to seal the file to prohibit disclosure of the discovery outside of the litigation. The trial court also denied this request.Grange then filed a petition with the Court of Appeals for a “writ of prohibition barring the Owsley Circuit Court ... from compelling ... production ... of confidential business and trade secrets, burdensome and expensive historic data of limited relevance, and irrelevant information unrelated to the issues in the case, or limiting production to relevant information subject to appropriate Protective Orders.” Grange also described the relief it was seeking as a request that the Court of Appeals “craft[ ] a discovery order which gives [Wilder] all discovery which is relevant to his claims, balanced against the legitimate needs of the Petitioner to be protected against unwarranted public disclosure, undue burden and expense, and profiteering,” or at the very least, “[s]eal this file,” prohibit Wilder from copying the discovery, and require that Wilder return the discovery at the conclusion of the case. Grange claimed that the production of the documents would cause irreparable harm and could not be adequately remedied on appeal. The Court of Appeals denied the petition because it found that while Grange would not have an adequate remedy on appeal, it had failed to prove irreparable harm.

Investigators believe that Staves was the leader of the gang and the drug trafficking operation.Police arrested Wayne on February 1, 2001, after intercepted telephone conversations and investigators’ surveillance of a suspected drug “stash house” led police to believe that a drug transaction had occurred. A kilogram of cocaine was found in the trunk of the vehicle in which Wayne left the house. Staves was arrested on September 6, 2001, after a warrant was issued for his arrest. A grand jury returned a 34-count indictment against Staves, Wayne, and 24 other people for various drug-trafficking related offenses.Staves filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained from the interception of communications from several telephone lines used by Staves, or in the alternative to order a hearing under Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). District Judge Audrey Collins issued the order authorizing the first wiretap on July 11, 2000. After District Judge Stephen V. Wilson denied the motion to suppress, Staves filed a “renewed” motion to suppress wiretap evidence or to order a Franks hearing, which the district court orally denied. Wayne joined both motions.Staves and Wayne then conditionally pled guilty, respectively, to conspiracy to possess and distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of narcotics. Both Staves and Wayne reserved the right to appeal the denial of the motions to suppress. The district court sentenced Staves to 240 months in prison, followed by a ten-year term of supervised release. It sentenced Wayne to 188 months in prison, with four years of supervised release.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"At approximately 2:30 in the morning of January 25,1992, the Collier County Sheriffs Department received a complaint about a residence in the Pelican Bay area. The complainant told police that he had heard gunshots and loud music coming from a house that he estimated to be four to five houses up the street. In response, two deputies drove to the area. Although Defendant’s residence was only three houses up the street, the deputies noticed that it was the only house on the street that had lights on. Further, the deputies observed several cars parked at the residence that were not of a type normally found in that neighborhood. Knowing that a string of burglaries had recently occurred in Defendant’s neighborhood while the residents were at home and fearing that a violent burglary had occurred at Defendant’s home, the deputies went to Defendant’s door to ascertain the welfare of the residents inside.After knocking on Defendant’s front door for several minutes without response, one of the deputies passed through an area that was enclosed by a fence and went around to the back of the house. The deputy noticed two individuals through the rear sliding glass door who appeared to be sleeping. He then knocked on the sliding door until one of the individuals, dressed in “biker” clothing, awoke and came to the door. The deputy explained that he was investigating a complaint about gun shots and was concerned about the safety of the residents in the house. The deputy then entered the house, and Defendant emerged from his bedroom brandishing a gun. The deputy identified himself as a police officer and ordered several times that Defendant put down his weapon. When Defendant finally complied with this order, the deputy noticed several weapons, including a sawed-off shotgun, in plain view on Defendant’s bed.Defendant was subsequently charged with possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(d) and 5871. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the physical evidence that the deputies obtained from his house on the grounds that it was the fruit of an unconstitutional search, and the Court referred the issue to a magistrate judge. The magistrate held a hearing and filed a report recommending that the Court deny Defendant’s motion. Defendant objected to the magistrate’s recommendation, and after considering the contested portions de novo, the Court denied Defendant’s motion.On September 4, 1992, Defendant conditionally pled guilty to Count I of the Indictment and reserved his right to appeal the Court’s denial of his motion. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the Court’s decision on September 23, 1994. Defendant then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which was denied on February 21, 1995. Defendant filed his § 2255 motion on May 6, 1996, and he has filed several additional motions since then.","{'Sender': 'Collier County Sheriffs Department ', 'Sender Role': 'Law Enforcement ', 'Recipient': 'Defendant ', 'Recipient Role': 'Resident ', 'About': 'Defendant ', 'About Role': 'Resident ', 'Type': 'Physical presence and possession of firearms ', 'Purpose': 'Investigation of a complaint about gunshots ', 'In Reply To': 'None ', 'Consented By': 'None ', 'Belief': ""Police officers believed that a violent burglary had occurred at Defendant's home.""}"

A search of Ms. Eeheverria’s person revealed a firearm and narcotics. Detective Chacon asked her whether she knew of anyone else who possessed like items. Ms. Echeverría responded that her husband possessed both a firearm and drugs and usually kept them in his car. She said that he was home at that time and described the car as a silver or gray Honda Civic. At Chacon’s request, other officers conducted surveillance on the home until he arrived. They saw a vehicle leave the home and attempted to follow it, but lost it and returned to the home.When Detective Chacon arrived at the Echeverría home, the officers knocked on the main door but received no answer. They then saw that the side door was open and knocked on it, but again they heard no response. While at the side door Chacon noticed a silver Honda Civic parked toward the rear of the home, in a driveway that looped into the backyard.

With this corroboration of Ms. Eeheverria’s statement, he searched the Honda, finding methamphetamine, cocaine, and $6,888 in cash.Mr. Echeverría was indicted on three counts: one relating to the methamphetamine, one relating to the cocaine, and one charging that he had carried a firearm in connection with a drug offense.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"The seeds of acrimony in this case can be described briefly. Pacitti and Durr both own condominiums in a community called “Seapointe,” in Key Colony Beach, Florida. In March 2003, Durr was appointed President of the Seapointe Condominium Association Board of Directors. In that capacity, he wrote Pacitti a series of letters regarding matters related to the Association, and he included allegations that Pacitti had failed to timely pay his association fees, had made unapproved renovations to his condominium, and was violating the Seapointe guest policy. Durr mentioned these same issues in memoran-da and letters he sent to other Seapointe unit owners. Pacitti alleges that Durr also searched public records regarding encumbrances on Pacitti’s unit, entered Pacitti’s unit without permission while it was being remodeled, and made a derogatory remark about Pacitti’s Italian heritage after an Association meeting.Cinquegrana owns a construction company that was hired by Pacitti and other unit owners to perform renovation projects at Seapointe. As President of the Board, Durr sent Cinquegrana letters concerning Association matters, including alleged damage to a Seapointe elevator and payment for engineering work performed at Seapointe by an associate of Cinquegra-na’s. Cinquegrana also alleges that, during a face-to-face confrontation, Durr called him a liar and a thief and made an offensive remark about his Italian heritage.Pacitti and Cinquegrana filed suit against Durr in the Western District of Pennsylvania, where Durr maintains his principle residence. As noted earlier, Pa-citti alleges state law claims for defamation, invasion of privacy, and ethic intimidation, and Cinquegrana alleges a claim for defamation. The District Court granted summary judgment to Durr on all of the claims and issued a thorough explanation of its holding. The Court applied Pennsylvania law and concluded that the communications that formed the basis for Pacitti’s defamation claims, to the extent they could be attributed to Durr, were either substantially true, or privileged, or not capable of defamatory meaning. The Court further determined that Pacitti had failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish his claim for invasion of privacy. Finally, the Court held that, because Pacit-ti had not established any of the offenses that are a prerequisite for a claim of ethnic intimidation, he could not maintain that claim either. As to Cinquegrana’s defamation claim, the Court determined that the communications complained of, to the extent not already addressed by the analysis pertaining to Pacitti’s claims, were only published to Cinquegrana himself, not to any third party, and therefore could not be defamatory.

Ji asserts that the Voucher controls while Bose contends that the Release trumps the Voucher.It is undisputed that Bose has made use of the photographs in violation of the terms of the Voucher, if those terms are effective, and the sole point of contention is which of the two documents constitutes a binding contract between the two parties.Ji’s Amended Complaint asserts four counts against Bose: Lanham Act false endorsement (Count I), a Florida statutory right to publicity (Count II), a common law right to privacy (Count III) and a violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 93A (“Chapter 93A”)(Count IV). It also contains two counts against White for violations of the Lanham Act (Count V) and Chapter 93A (Count VI). This Court allowed Bose’s motion for partial summary judgment against Ji on Count I, the Lanham Act claim, in a Memorandum and Order dated February 13, 2008, 538 F.Supp.2d 349 (Docket No. 86).","{'Sender': 'Ji', 'Sender Role': 'Model', 'Recipient': 'White', 'Recipient Role': 'Photographer', 'About': 'Ji', 'About Role': 'Model', 'Type': 'Photographs', 'Purpose': 'Advertising', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Ji', 'Belief': 'None'}"
,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"The issue presented in this appeal is whether a search at a sobriety checkpoint violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution if motorists are not given advance publicity of the checkpoint. The Court holds that it does not.On June 20, 1992, between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 1:00 a.m., federal police officers conducted a “systematic vehicle inspection” checkpoint outside the Imjin Road Gate to Fort Ord Army Reserve. The police directed every fifth vehicle into an established inspection site and allowed all other vehicles to pass without inspection and search. At approximately 11:52 a.m., the police counted Defendant’s car as a fifth vehicle and directed Defendant to drive into a designated parking stall within the army reserve area. While conducting the inspection and search, the officers detected the smell of alcohol on Defendant’s breath. Defendant was subsequently asked to perform a series of field sobriety tests, which he failed. The police also observed several containers of beer in the rear seat of Defendant’s vehicle. Based on these circumstances, Defendant was charged with driving under the influence and driving with a blood alcohol content of over 0.08%. Defendant later submitted to a urine test, which indicated that Defendant had a blood alcohol content of 0.19%.Defendant waived his right to trial before a U.S. District Court Judge and instead consented to be tried by a U.S. Magistrate Judge. Defendant subsequently filed a motion to suppress evidence and to dismiss the case. The motion essentially sought to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the systematic vehicle inspection on the grounds that the search was unreasonable and conducted in violation of Defendant’s constitutional rights.On January 7, 1993, Magistrate Judge Garrett granted Defendant’s motion finding that Defendant’s stop was unconstitutional because advance publicity of the vehicle checkpoint was not a part of the guidelines followed. Since the evidence was suppressed and there was no further evidence (ie. of express or implied consent) to sustain the government’s charges, the case was dismissed.Plaintiff now appeals the Magistrate Judge’s order. Plaintiff argues on appeal that: (1) Magistrate Judge Garrett erred by finding that systematic vehicle inspections require advance publicity in order-to be constitutionally valid; (2) even if advanced publicity is required for civilian checkpoints, it is not required for inspections that take place on a military base because of the important federal government interests involved; and (3) even if the systematic vehicle inspection had not taken place, Defendant would still have been inspected upon entry to Fort Ord at the Imjin Gate.","{'Sender': 'Federal police officers', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement', 'Recipient': 'Defendant', 'Recipient Role': 'Driver', 'About': 'Defendant', 'About Role': 'Driver', 'Type': 'Personal information (breath, urine test results)', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

Culbreath, the firm’s only practitioner, filed an eight-count complaint with the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint alleged that the unsolicited fax violated Section 227(b)(1) of the TCPA. In addition, Culbreath sought damages for violations of Section 227(d) of the TCPA and 68.318(d), Title 47, C.F.R., for the fax’s technical defects (i.e., its lack of identifying information). The remaining counts sought damages under the OCSPA for each alleged TCPA violation. Culbreath prayed for treble damages for the TCPA violations and statutory damages along with attorney fees under the OCSPA.{¶ 7} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in Culbreath’s favor and against U.S. Four, W.D.

At that time, Border Patrol Agent Joel Sims was working at the primary inspection area. While questioning Defendant about his citizenship, Agent Sims observed that Defendant’s hands and arms trembled. In response to further questioning about his itinerary, Defendant stated that he was travelling from Phoenix, Arizona, to his home in Garden City, Kansas, and that he travelled a lot because he was a federal grain inspector. When asked why he was taking such an indirect route between these two locations, Defendant replied that he was paid by the mile. Agent Sims noticed that Defendant became nervous and trembled even more.{3} After asking for and obtaining permission to inspect Defendant’s vehicle with a border-patrol dog, Agent Sims directed Defendant to the secondary inspection area in order to allow the dog to detect any suspicious odors emanating from Defendant’s truck. Border Patrol Agent Jesus Torres, who was also stationed at the checkpoint, accompanied Defendant to the other side of the traffic lane while Agent Sims accompanied the border-patrol dog around Defendant’s truck. The dog alerted at the rear of Defendant’s truck and indicated in the direction of the spare tire mounted underneath it. In the process of removing the spare tire from beneath the truck, Agent Sims noticed that it was heavy and uninflated. He cut the tire open with a knife and found eleven bundles of marijuana inside. When the marijuana was discovered, Agent Torres took Defendant inside a trailer at the checkpoint and placed him under arrest. Agent Donald Humphrey and his partner, who worked for the Otero County Narcotics Enforcement Unit, were summoned to the checkpoint to take custody of Defendant, his truck, and the bundles of marijuana.{4} Defendant was brought to trial in the Otero County District Court on one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. When the State sought to introduce photographs of the bundles of marijuana at trial, Defendant’s trial counsel moved to suppress the photographs on the grounds that the marijuana was the fruit of an unlawful search under Gomez, 1997-NMSC-006, ¶ 39, 122 N.M. 777, 932 P.2d 1. The State asserted that Gomez did not apply, but was given the opportunity to elicit testimony from the State’s witnesses to show the presence of exigent circumstances justifying the warrant-less search.{5} The district court ruled that it would not apply Gomez retroactively, or, in the alternative, that the testimony elicited by the State was sufficient to make a particularized showing of exigent circumstances. The photographs of the marijuana were admitted into evidence and a jury found Defendant guilty of one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.

After unlocking the door, they found Mr. Rios lying on the bed and a pistol nearby. The two immediately left the room and called 911 in accordance with the motel’s policy regarding weapons on motel premises.The assistant manager testified that she met an officer at the door to Room 808 and gave him the key card that he used to let himself in.

He entered the room and detained Mr. Rios, who was later arrested.After being indicted on the firearms charge, Mr. Rios filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence, claiming that officers conducted an unlawful search of the motel room. The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing and overruled the motion. It held that Mr. Rios lacked standing to challenge the search because he could not demonstrate that he was the invited guest of the renter of the room.Mr. Rios then filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that new evidence indicated that he was the lawful guest of the room’s registered renter, Sheena Craig. The motion attached an affidavit by Craig. It stated that after renting the room she had to go home to deal with a family emergency and had given Mr. Rios permission to stay overnight in the room.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Facts and ProceedingsIn 1939, Professor Wendell Johnson of the University of Iowa (f/k/a “The State University of Iowa”) designed a study to test his diagnosogenic (or labeling) theory of stuttering. Professor Johnson believed nonstutterers could become stutterers if others labeled them as stutterers. Professor Johnson directed Mary Tudor, a graduate student at the University, to conduct the study on children at the Iowa Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home.To test Professor Johnson’s theory, six nonstuttering children at the Home were told they were stutterers or were in danger of becoming stutterers. These children (or their respective estates) are the plaintiffs in the underlying action. They were given negative “therapy” designed to make them stutter. At the conclusion of the study, Tudor concluded all six children displayed a loss of self-confidence, self-image, and self-esteem. Tudor observed detrimental effects on their speech delivery. Over the next few decades the experiment was labeled the “Monster Study,” and the title persists today.For over sixty years, no one told the children about the true nature of the study. In June 2001, however, a newspaper discovered the truth and published a story about the Monster Study.In April 2003, the plaintiffs sued the State in the district court for intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, invasion of privacy, and civil conspiracy. The plaintiffs claimed the State’s tor-tious actions continued to the present day because it concealed the study from them over the years.The State filed a motion to dismiss. It maintained the plaintiffs’ claims failed because the alleged injuries occurred when the State was sovereignly immune, i.e., before the effective date of the Iowa Tort Claims Act.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"At all times relevant to this litigation, Ramon Portales operated the warehouse of the RPI Pallet Company in Monee, Illinois (“RPI”) and a farm in Manhattan. Illinois. On at least four occasions in the late 1990’s, Portales successfully allowed drug traffickers to use the farm to offload trucks containing marijuana. The traffickers then distributed the marijuana within the Chicago area. Their luck ran out when, during a commercial vehicle inspection in January 1999, the Missouri Highway Patrol discovered that one of the trucks on its way to Portales’s farm contained both limes and, in a hidden compartment, bundles of marijuana wrapped in colored paper. A Highway Patrol officer unwrapped one of the bundles, confirmed that it contained marijuana, and then re-wrapped the bundle, put it back in the secret compartment, and re-sealed the compartment. The traffickers driving the truck promptly agreed to assist authorities in a controlled delivery of the marijuana (presumably in exchange for leniency), and then proceeded to Illinois with police to deliver the marijuana to Portales’s farm. When the truck reached the Chicago area, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) took over supervision of the controlled delivery.As the truck drivers approached their destination, they called co-conspirators and learned that this particular shipment was to be unloaded at RPI instead of the farm. DEA agents watched the truck without interruption as, and after, it arrived at RPI on January 25. During the morning of January 26,1999, DEA agents observed various people unload stacks of pallets from the truck to the loading docks for several hours. At about 11:25 a.m., police saw a co-conspirator enter the trailer with an orange extension cord. Then at roughly 1:50 p.m., the co-conspirator returned with a truck, towing a horse trailer. Believing that the conspirators were about to leave with the marijuana in the horse trailer, the DEA agents moved in.In the warehouse, the agents saw, inter alia, crates filled with visible block-shaped bundles wrapped in colored paper. As Portales admits, “from their smell and shape, the agents believed [the bundles] contained marijuana.” Without a warrant, the agents opened some of the bundles and confirmed that the bundles contained marijuana. Portales was then arrested and, as discussed above, convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 and possessing with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).Portales raises three issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress physical evidence of the marijuana; (2) whether the district court committed clear error in denying Portales a sentencing reduction under the “safety valve” of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2; and (3) whether the district court erred in denying Portales a sentencing reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2 for being a minor participant.","{'Sender': 'Missouri Highway Patrol officer, DEA agents', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement officers', 'Recipient': 'Co-conspirators, Ramon Portales', 'Recipient Role': 'Drug traffickers, warehouse operator', 'About': 'Marijuana', 'About Role': 'Drug traffickers, warehouse operator', 'Type': 'Physical evidence (marijuana)', 'Purpose': 'Law enforcement investigation and prosecution', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'The bundles contained marijuana.'}"

Justified or not, it was not long after the Plaintiff began working as a bailiff that the Judge began to receive unsettling reports from his staff about the Plaintiffs behavior. These included recountings of the Plaintiff attempting to obtain the telephone numbers of females who appeared in the Judge’s court or who happened to be walking in the corridors of the courthouse, see Mayer Deposition, at 87-89; leaving sexually suggestive materials in court, see id. at 93; proselytizing his religious beliefs during work hours, see id. at 175, including reading the Bible in the courtroom and its public reception area, see id. at 178-80, 190, 221, and preaching and reading the Bible to prisoners who were in a holding cell waiting to appear before the Judge, see id. at 177; failing to answer the telephone, see id. at 228; arriving late for work, see id. at 82; and"" creating a disturbance with court security officers, see id. at 103. These problems prompted the Judge to present the Plaintiff with a letter in June, 1990 warning him that “any continuance of the matters set. out in this letter will result in your dismissal.” Defendants’ Exhibit A. The Judge identified six problem areas that warranted the Plaintiffs immediate attention: (1) “Witnessing”, (2) “Reading Materials”, (3) “Working Hours”, (4) “Lunch Hour”, (5) “Phones” and (6) “Absence during working hours.” Id. In the Judge’s view, the Plaintiff failed to make adequate progress modifying his behavior, resulting in his dismissal on September 7, 1990.The Plaintiff believes that he was subjected to a hostile work environment and discharged because of his race and religious beliefs. He contends, inter alia., that he fell out of the Judge’s favor after he refused to contribute a portion of his salary to the Republican Party and did not work at the polls on election day. His complaint sets forth claims against the Defendant for violation of his rights to freedom of religion, liberty, political affiliation and association, equal protection, and due process of law. The Court will address each of these allegations individually after describing the standard for evaluating the Defendant’s motion.","{'Sender': 'Judge ', 'Sender Role': 'Employer ', 'Recipient': ""Judge's staff "", 'Recipient Role': 'Coworkers ', 'About': 'The Plaintiff ', 'About Role': 'Employee ', 'Type': 'Behavioral information ', 'Purpose': 'Report issues with employee behavior ', 'In Reply To': 'None ', 'Consented By': 'None ', 'Belief': ""Judge received unsettling reports about the Plaintiff's behavior""}"

They decided to operate a checking station, or checkpoint, at the intersection of Smith Level Road and Damascus Church Road in Chapel Hill, that was to begin at 8:00 p.m. and continue for approximately two hours. Prior to initiating the checking station, Trooper Morrison contacted his superior, Sergeant Michael Stuart (""Sergeant Stuart""), to request authorization. Sergeant Stuart gave his authorization, and later completed a ""checking station authorization"" form (""the form""). At the hearing, Sergeant Stuart testified he was unsure of when he filled out the form, but that it was likely the next day, 1 August 2013. The form noted that the primary purpose of the checking station was to ask for driver's licenses, and that the station would operate from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.At approximately 9:45 p.m., a vehicle driven by Defendant approached on Damascus Church Road and stopped at the checking station. Trooper Morrison did not notice any violation of the law as Defendant approached. Trooper Morrison requested Defendant's driver's license, which Defendant produced. Detecting the odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle, Trooper Morrison asked Defendant whether he had been drinking. Defendant responded: ""You got me. I had about five beers back to back, drank them real quick."" Trooper Morrison conducted field sobriety tests on Defendant and, after determining that Defendant was impaired, arrested him for driving while impaired. A chemical analysis later revealed that Defendant's blood-alcohol concentration at the time of his arrest was 0.08.Prior to trial, Defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of the stop. Defendant argued that the checking station violated his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Article I, Sections 19, 20 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. Defendant's motion was heard on 17 November 2014. The State presented the testimony of Trooper Morrison and Sergeant Stuart. Following witness testimony and arguments of counsel, the trial court took the matter under advisement. The trial court entered a written order on 19 November 2014 denying Defendant's motion to suppress. The case proceeded to trial. At trial, Defendant failed to timely object to the admission of evidence obtained as a result of the checkpoint stop. Defendant was convicted by a jury on 25 March 2015 of driving while impaired.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"During a ninth grade government class, Miles stated that the quality of the school had declined since 1967. When a student asked for specific examples, Miles replied that in the past the school did not have so many pop cans lying around and school discipline was better. He also commented, “I don’t think in 1967 you would have seen two students making out on the tennis court.” This comment referred to an incident that allegedly had occurred the previous day and was the topic of rumor throughout the school. The rumor was that two students were observed having sexual intercourse on the tennis court during lunch hour. Miles had heard the rumor from a colleague who had heard of the incident from two students claiming to have witnessed it. Miles never sought official confirmation of the rumor before repeating it in class.Miles’ comments about the rumor led parents of the alleged participants to complain to the principal. Following meetings with Miles and several other individuals, the principal placed Miles on paid administrative leave for four days. Miles wrote to the principal apologizing for exercising “bad judgment.” The principal conducted an investigation and issued a reprimand letter that stated:After completing the investigation of the alleged incident in your period 3 class on March 30, 1989, I find it necessary to write you this letter of reprimand. The investigation revealed that you displayed poor judgment in your comment “making out” on the tennis court. Informing your students of an alleged incident of one of your tennis players “making out” with a female student on the tennis courts during the lunch period was an inappropriate topic for comment in a classroom setting.In the future you will need to refrain from commenting on any items which might reflect negatively on individual members of our student body.Eight months after his reinstatement, Miles filed this lawsuit claiming that the imposition of paid administrative leave and placement of the letter of reprimand in his file violated and “chilled” his free speech rights.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"and Defendant’s ContentionsAt the conclusion of all of the evidence, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal as to five of the burglary counts, contending that A.B.’s testimony was insufficient to support a jury finding that defendant entered mother’s home on five of the charged occasions. The trial court denied defendant’s motion on the basis raised by defendant, finding sufficient evidence to proceed to jury deliberation on these counts. The court then considered a separate basis for a judgment of acquittal that defendant did not raise himself: “There is a separate issue, and that is a consent issue. ... [¶] ... To support a consent defense the evidence has to show that the occupant, that is [A.B.], expressly invited the defendant into the bedroom. [¶] In reviewing my notes I don’t find any evidence of an express invitation before October 14th or October 15th. So I don’t find that one of the prerequisites to a consent defense is supported by the evidence. The jury may take a different tack on this, but I would not dismiss any of the burglary charges based on a purported consent defense until—through October 14th, 15th.” The court reasoned that while there was evidence of A.B.’s express consent to enter the home on October 14th, the night of the kidnapping, there was not sufficient evidence that A.B. knew of defendant’s felonious intent. Thus, the court ruled that “the consent defense would [not] justify dismissing any of the burglary charges.” However, the court later instructed the jury on the consent defense in a special instruction requested by defendant.On appeal, defendant contends the trial court erred in ruling an “ ‘express invitation’ ” is required to establish the consent defense to burglary charges. Defendant also argues that the trial court should have granted his section 1118.1 motion because there was substantial evidence that A.B. consented to defendant’s entry into her mother’s home and did so with knowledge of his felonious intent, i.e., that defendant intended to have sex with her.","{'Sender': 'Defendant', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Trial court', 'Recipient Role': 'None', 'About': 'A.B.', 'About Role': 'Victim', 'Type': 'Personal and private information', 'Purpose': 'Legal defense', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Insufficient evidence for a consent defense to burglary charges'}"

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In November 1989, Ortiz requested disclosure of the letter from HHS. Her request was denied in March 1990. The reason given by HHS for the denial was that under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D) (Exemption 7(D)) the letter was exempt from FOIA disclosure because its release could disclose the identity of a confidential source. Ortiz’s administrative appeal to HHS was denied in April 1991. The reasons given for the denial of the appeal were that the appeal was filed out of time, and that the letter was exempt from disclosure under both Exemption 7(D) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C) (Exemption 7(C)), which authorizes the withholding of records where disclosure could constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.In January 1992, Ortiz filed suit in the district court challenging HHS’s determination and seeking disclosure of the letter. The parties stipulated to the admissibility of certain exhibits for judgment on an undisputed set of facts. Reviewing the letter in camera and conducting a de novo review of HHS’s decision, the district court determined in a written opinion that the agency had properly withheld the letter. See 874 F.Supp. 570 (S.D.N.Y.1995). The court found that Exemption 7(D) applied because the author was properly considered to be a confidential source and disclosure of any part of the letter was likely to reveal the author’s identity. Id. at 574. Exemption 7(C) also applied because, balancing the privacy interest of the author of the letter against the public interest in disclosure, release of the letter would reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.

More specifically, the IRS contends that some of the documents to which this court extended the work product doctrine would have been created in similar form in connection with Chevron’s tax returns, financial reporting obligations, and/or tax accrual assessment. Memorandum at 1.In support of its argument the IRS points to Chevron’s “privilege log.” The log indicates that members of Chevron’s Tax Compliance Group (the personnel responsible for filing Chevron’s tax returns) and Price Waterhouse “auditors” were involved in the challenged transaction. According to the IRS, the involvement of these personnel together with Chevron’s summaries of some documents’ raise a suspicion that Price Waterhouse auditors assisted Chevron’s Compliance personnel in filing Chevron’s tax returns and/or determining how to treat the transaction for purposes of Chevron’s financial reporting obligations. If this is true, the IRS continues, then some of the withheld documents might have been created in essentially similar form in the normal course of preparing Chevron’s tax returns or complying with SEC financial reporting requirements.The Brechtel Declaration responds to these contentions.

After about a year of employment as a police officer, the City laid off Delahoussaye for economic reasons. Shortly before Delahoussaye was to have been re-employed, a campus police officer informed the New Iberia Police Department (the Department) about Delahous-saye’s earlier detentions by the campus police. After a pre-disciplinary hearing, the City removed Delahoussaye’s name from its civil service re-employment list because the City concluded that Delahous-saye’s actions in connection with the detentions were prejudicial to the Department and contrary to the public interest.Delahoussaye sued the City of New Iberia and the University, alleging, inter alia, that the University violated his rights to due process and equal protection by revealing information concerning the detentions to the Department, and that the City violated these same rights by removing his name from its re-employment list.

In order to protect its transmissions from unauthorized reception, DIRECTV encrypts — or scrambles— its satellite signal, and each DIRECTV customer is required to purchase system hardware and an access card. The access cards function as de-scramblers; they allow subscribers to view the programming for which they have paid and only that programming.Satellite television pirates have found ways to modify their access cards so as to view DIRECTV programming without paying for it. In response, DIRECTV has developed electronic countermeasures or ECMs, which are streams of data sent along with its satellite signal that target and disable modified access cards. In turn, the pirates have countered with a variety of devices — referred to as pirate-access devices — that restore their modified access cards’ ability to gain unauthorized access to DIRECTV’s programming.On August 21, 2003, DIRECTV filed this lawsuit against Baker.

Section 1(A)(2) of Bill 14 provides:(A) 'A lawyer may not send a written communication, directly or through an agent, to a prospective client for the purpose of obtaining professional employment if the communication concerns: ...(2) a criminal prosecution, or a prosecution of a traffic offense that carries a period of incarceration, involving the person to whom the communication is addressed or the person’s relative, unless the charging document was filed more than 30 days before the date the communication is mailed.Pursuant to Section 10-606 of Maryland’s Business and Occupations Code, any person who violates the new law may be found guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or incarceration for up to one year. The new law went into effect on October 1,1996.Plaintiff Ficker is a Maryland attorney who alleges that, until this bill went into effect, he obtained virtually all of his client base through direct-mail solicitation of those charged with jailable traffic offenses. Plaintiff Boehm owns and operates a company that produces and mails advertising materials from attorneys to persons who have been charged with crimes and jailable offenses. Both Ficker and Boehm challenge § 1(A)(2) as violative of their First Amendment rights of free speech and seek an order declaring § 1(A)(2) unconstitutional and permanently enjoining its enforcement.This is a somewhat unusual case in that the Attorney General, the party now asking the Court to uphold the constitutionality of § 1(A)(2), is also the party that has provided the Court with perhaps the most compelling arguments against the constitutionality of that same provision. Before Governor Glendening signed the subject legislation, the Attorney General’s office reviewed the bill for constitutionality and legal sufficiency. See Letter from Joseph Curran to Governor Glendening, dated May 16, 1996 (attached to Defendant’s Motion as Exhibit 1). Upon review of the bill, the Attorney General’s office concluded, “it is our view that the portions of the bill restricting contact with persons who have been charged with traffic and criminal offenses are invalid and should not be enforced.” Id. at 1. Despite the infirmities of the portion of the bill that this Court now reviews, the Attorney General recommended that the Governor sign the legislation, based on the conclusion that the provisions of the bill regulating solicitation of personal injury plaintiffs was constitutional and the two provisions were expressly made severable.","{'Sender': 'Plaintiff Ficker and Plaintiff Boehm', 'Sender Role': 'Maryland Attorneys and owner of a company that produces and mails advertising materials from attorneys', 'Recipient': 'Prospective clients charged with jailable traffic offenses', 'Recipient Role': 'None', 'About': 'Prospective clients charged with jailable traffic offenses', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Written communication', 'Purpose': 'Obtain professional employment', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(ii) and 552(a)(6)(C); J.A. at'4 (Compl.).The district court denied appellant’s motion for summary judgment and instead granted the government’s cross-motion for summary judgment, based on its conclusion that (1) “the information plaintiff seeks is already public information in the various counties”; and' (2) “plaintiffs request appears to be inapposite to the purpose of FOIA” since “[p]laintiff seeks information about private citizens for its own business purposes.” J.A. at 7-8 (Order at 2-3). Having resolved the case on such grounds, the district court decided that it no longer needed to consider whether any exemptions applied to appellant’s requests. ■ J.A at 8 (Order at 3). Both appellant and appellee agree that the district court’s order was grounded on faulty reasoning as a matter of law, but while appellant further contends that the requested information does not fall within any FOIA exemption category, the government argues that it does. The district court had original jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Computer Associates International, Inc. (CA), creates and licenses computer software. CA licensed its programs to the appellee, National Car Rental Systems, Inc. (National), to process National’s data on National’s hardware in Bloomington, Minnesota. The 1990 license agreement between CA and National provided, as did earlier licenses, that National may use the licensed programs “only for the internal operations of Licensee and for the processing of its own data.” A separate order form, incorporated into the license agreement, similarly provided that “use of the Licensed Program[s] is restricted to the internal operations of Licensee and for the processing of its own data.”Sometime in 1990, National decided to cease its internal computer operations and contract with an independent computer services vendor for computer related information services. Ultimately, National retained Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS) to provide these services. In connection with this transaction, National, EDS, and CA entered into a supplement addendum, which provided that EDS could use the licensed programs to process National’s data. The supplement addendum provided that EDS would use the programs for the benefit of National subject to the terms and conditions of the 1990 license agreement, and solely “to process data of Licensee and in no event for the processing of data ... of any third party other than Licensee.”CA subsequently determined that National had been using the programs to process the data of third parties, including Lend Lease Trucks, Inc. (Lend Lease), and Tilden Car Rental, Inc. (Tilden), in violation of the license agreement, and that such use had continued through EDS under the supplement addendum. CA threatened to sue National if such use did not stop. National then brought a declaratory judgment action in the district court. National admitted in its complaint that it “has used the Licensed Software in its business activities ... including the activities relating to Tilden and Trucks [Lend Lease],” but requested a declaration that its use of the programs neither breached the license agreement nor infringed CA’s copyright. CA asserted two counterclaims. In the first, it claimed that National’s use of the programs, either individually or through EDS, for the benefit of Lend Lease and Tilden, breached the license agreement. In the second, CA claimed that National infringed its copyright by making an unauthorized copy of the software.National moved for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), alleging that CA’s first counterclaim was preempted under § 301(a) of the Copyright Act. In resolving the motion, the district court concluded that CA alleged a lease agreement between National and the third parties: National permitted them to use the software in exchange for payment. The district court concluded that this cause of action, as pled, was “equivalent” to the exclusive copyright right of distribution of copies of the work, and held it was preempted.","{'Sender': 'Computer Associates International, Inc.

The complaint is based on negligence and seeks only compensatory damages. Defendant denied liability.On October 1, 2002, plaintiff propounded interrogatories and a request to produce documents. The interrogatories contained many of the standard interrogatories approved in Illinois for matrimonial cases and requested detailed information on defendant’s sources of income, real estate holdings, business interests, bank accounts, investments, securities, life insurance policies, retirement accounts, debts, and personal property ownership. The request to produce documents sought copies of defendant’s federal and state income-tax returns and all documents indicating his income, real property interests, investments, securities, retirement accounts, and personal property interests.Defendant objected to these discovery requests on the basis the information sought was not relevant or material to any matter at issue in the lawsuit and would not become discoverable unless plaintiff obtained a judgment against him that exceeded the limits of his liability insurance policy. On October 10, 2002, he answered the remaining interrogatories and requests to produce that did not seek personal financial information.On October 23, 2002, plaintiff filed a motion to compel answers to the remaining interrogatories and production requests. On December 19, 2002, the trial court granted the motion to compel, finding the information sought in the supreme court-approved matrimonial interrogatories and in plaintiffs request to produce was relevant to the pending personal injury negligence case.The trial court ordered defendant to respond within 28 days.

McNulty had previously shopped at McRae’s and Dillard’s department stores in the same mall, and entered the J.C. Penney with a McRae’s cart that already contained two large shopping bags. McNulty asserts that she was using this cart for support because of her physical ailments.During her visit to the store, McNulty aroused the suspicion of an associate who reported that McNulty had repeatedly entered the fitting room with merchandise. Eric Greene, an off-duty police officer employed as a security guard by J.C. Penney, viewed a security camera feed and observed McNulty select a number of items and place them in her cart. McNulty was videotaped shopping for approximately thirty minutes. During this time, she repeatedly gathered items from the shelves and put them on top of the bags in the cart that she already had from another store. She proceeded to purchase clothing at a merchandise counter. McNulty paid for certain items of clothing, but a brassiere for which she had not paid remained in her cart. The videotape appears to show the item in plain view attached to the front of the shopping cart as McNulty shopped and purchased the other clothing. Greene’s statement indicated that McNulty acted suspiciously and then exited the store. She was stopped, escorted into a security office, and detained until a uniformed police officer arrived. McNulty became very upset during her detention, and claims that she developed a number of ailments, including temporary, stress-related blindness, as a result of her detention and subsequent arrest. The uniformed officer arrested McNulty for the state offense of shoplifting an item worth less than $500. McNulty was found not guilty of the offense on December 20, 2005.McNulty brought the instant case in Mississippi state court, claiming that the store’s actions were motivated by racial, religious, and gender bias, and that Greene and J.C. Penney committed malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, assault and battery, negligence, various intentional torts, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of her right to privacy. McNulty urges that her possession of the lingerie was inadvertent, and that the item had simply become latched onto her cart without her knowledge because the store was not compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (1990).

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,". To provide context, we summarize the evidence presented at the hearing on the defendant’s motion to suppress. On the evening of April 26, 2012, Detective Daniel Amaral of the New Bedford police department was driving an unmarked police cruiser assisting a narcotics surveillance team of police officers when he came upon a motor vehicle that he had stopped once before. During the earlier stop, Amaral had arrested the woman who normally drove that vehicle for heroin possession. He knew that the surveillance team was interested in the vehicle because of its connection to the earlier drug-related arrest. Accordingly, he followed the vehicle and thereafter received instruction from the surveillance team to pull it over.As Amaral followed the vehicle, he detected an odor of burnt marijuana coming from it. Based on the odor, and without having seen the driver of the vehicle commit any traffic violations, Amaral pulled the vehicle over and approached the driver’s side. The driver, a male, held in his right hand what Amáral recognized as a marijuana cigar. Amaral asked the driver whether the cigar was what was causing the odor, and the driver responded that it was. Amaral then confiscated the cigar and asked for the driver’s license and registration. The stop continued, and in the course of it, police discovered a plastic bag in the vehicle containing sixty Percocet pills. The defendant, a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the stop, was charged with possession with intent to distribute a class B substance in violation of G. L. c. 94C, § 32A (a), conspiracy to violate the drugs laws under G. L. c. 94C, § 40, and a drug violation near a school or park under G. L. c. 94C, § 32J — all in connection with the pills.On November 30, 2012, the defendant moved to suppress evidence of the pills. The motion judge held an evidentiary hearing on May 3, 2013; the only issue addressed was the propriety of the motor vehicle stop. Following the hearing, the judge concluded that the odor of burnt marijuana, coupled with other “suspicious activity implicating but not rising to drug activity” involving the vehicle, justified the stop. A single justice of this court granted the defendant’s request for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal of the order denying the motion to suppress, and directed the appeal to be heard in the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996); G. L. c. 211, § 4A.

He explained that it was a rental property with no current tenants and that no one should be inside. M.G. then saw that one of the home's front windows was cracked open and, peering inside, he saw a figure in the house. He yelled through the window, demanding that any occupants leave the house. The officers banged on the front door and ordered all the occupants to come outside. Ultimately, Sawyer and three others came out and stood with the officers on the porch.M.G. then asked the officers to ""go inside and check my house."" In the basement, officers found a backpack; they opened it immediately and discovered four guns inside. The searching officers used the radio to inform the officers outside, who placed Sawyer and the three others in custody. The officers who had searched the backpack brought it outside. Officer Jorie Wood, who had remained outside, then opened the backpack and found a cell phone. She gave Miranda warnings to the arrestees and asked them who owned the phone. Sawyer responded that it was his phone and his bag. Wood later asked Sawyer again if it was his bag, and that time, he said no.After he was indicted, Sawyer moved to suppress the contents of the backpack and his statements about it. He argued that the officers lacked probable cause or consent to search it. The government responded that Sawyer had no ""standing"" to contest the search because he failed to provide evidence that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the backpack, and that even if he had, Sawyer, as a trespasser, had no legitimate expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize. The government also argued that the officers obtained consent from the owner to search the home. The district court denied Sawyer's motion to suppress, concluding that Sawyer lacked ""standing"" to challenge the search because he was unlawfully present in the house and thus had no reasonable expectation of privacy there.

The McClain home was not Haston’s place of residence.Jennifer McClain and her father, James “Pete” McClain, Jr., both of whom did reside at that residence, met the deputies at the gate of the chain link fence that surrounds their property. When informed by the deputies of their intent to search for Haston in her residence, Jennifer McClain said that he was not present and she denied the deputies access to her home. Jennifer McClain then entered the house and proceeded to lock the doors.Deputy Daniel, however, alleges that Pete McClain, a former Deputy Sheriff, consented to the search of his residence. Pete McClain, who has suffered several strokes and is unable to communicate very effectively, claims that he did not give such consent. In any event, Deputy Sheriffs O’Hara and Matlack subsequently entered the McClain residence through the back door and searched for Haston. Jennifer McClain continued to object to the activities of the officers throughout their search. The Deputy Sheriffs searched the McClain residence, and they did not find Haston.Pete McClain and his wife, Tiny, along with their daughter, Jennifer McClain (collectively the “McClains”) thereafter brought suit, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against the Sheriff of Martin County, Florida, in his official capacity, and the Deputy Sheriffs who executed the search of their home. The Defendants answered the complaint, and then filed the instant motion for summary judgment. In the summary judgment motion, the Defendants assert that they were justified in entering the McClain residence pursuant to Florida Statute Section 901.19(1) and that they violated no constitutional rights.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Plaintiffs Motown Record Corporation (Motown) and Jobete Music Company, Inc. (Jobete) brought this action against defendant George A. Hormel & Co. and Ruhr/Paragon, Inc. alleging copyright infringement, trademark infringement, seven pendent state claims and a claim for declaratory relief.In 1964, the songwriting team of Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland (Holland-Dozier-Holland) composed a musical composition entitled “Baby Love”. Holland-Dozier-Holland entered into exclusive songwriting agreements with plaintiff Jobete, pursuant to which Jobete was granted the copyright in the musical composition “Baby Love.” “Baby Love” was recorded by a trio of performing artists named “The Supremes.” The various recording artists on “The Supremes” changed over the years, but the group always consisted of three young black women. “The Supremes” frequently performed in formal gowns (often sequined) and had “bouffant” hairstyles. The name “The Supremes” was registered as a trademark by Motown, and such registration appears to be uncontested by defendants.Plaintiffs claim that in October of 1985, a Motown employee saw an advertisement broadcast on ABC-TV for Hormel’s “Dinty Moore” brand beef stew. The commercial, in part, featured three young black women, with bouffant hair, in sequined formal gowns singing “Dinty Moore, My Dinty Moore,” to the tune of the Motown classic “Baby Love.” Plaintiffs further contend that the use of the image of “The Supremes” in the commercial without Motown’s permission, coupled with the unlicensed use of the musical composition, is likely to cause confusion and create the misimpression by the public and the trade that Motown authorized the use of the image of “The Supremes.”Previously, the Court granted a Temporary Restraining Order and a Preliminary Injunction requiring defendants to cease the use of the offending advertisement.

Under Southeast’s insurance policy, Transportation had the duty to indemnify and defend claims that fell under an “advertising injury” provision covering an “injury arising out of ... [o]ral or written publication of material that violates a person’s right of privacy.” (Record Excerpts Tab 1 (Ex. C), Business Liability Coverage Form (“Policy”) at 10.) Penzer alleged that the claims against Southeast were covered by this provision because the transmission of an unsolicited facsimile advertisement constituted the publication of written material. Transportation filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that Southeast was not covered under the provision, because it was unambiguous and did not encompass Penzer’s claims, or in the alternative, because coverage was not required due to several policy exclusions.The district court granted a stay of proceedings pending the disposition of the appeal in Hooters of Augusta, Inc. v. American Global Insurance Co., a case involving coverage under the same policy provision for an identical TCPA violation.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,". In October, 2007, the Attorney General brought an enforcement action against Fremont in the Superior Court, alleging unfair and deceptive practices in Fremont’s mortgage lending business. During pretrial discovery, the Commonwealth and Fremont filed a joint motion for a protective order to govern the exchange of documents and information the parties claimed were confidential. The enforcement action judge entered such a protective order, and that order remains in effect.The order defines “Confidential Materials” as those “entitled to confidential treatment pursuant to Rule 26(c) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure” and designated as confidential by the producing party. Such materials are ordered to be used “only for the purposes of preparing for and conducting the [ljitigation” and are not to be disclosed to persons other than “Qualified Persons.” The Attorney General estimates that Fremont designated 5.5 million pages as confidential pursuant to the order, and the Attorney General did not challenge any of Fremont’s designations. The Attorney General and Fremont ultimately settled the case and a consent order was entered in June, 2009.In May, 2009, Lieberman wrote to the Attorney General, pursuant to the public records law, asserting a statutory right of access to certain categories of documents received by the Attorney General during the enforcement action. The Attorney General responded with a letter indicating that she would not produce copies of any of the documents designated confidential by Fremont.Lieberman thereafter filed the public records action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief compelling the Commonwealth to comply with his request under the public records law. Lieberman filed the action in the business litigation session of the Superior Court Department, where the protective order had been issued, but the case was denied acceptance into that session and was assigned to a judge in a different session. The Commonwealth subsequently filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and after a hearing the public records action judge granted the Commonwealth’s motion and dismissed Lieberman’s complaint.During the pendency of the public records action, Lieberman filed a motion to intervene in the enforcement action, or in the alternative to transfer the public records action to the business litigation session. Fremont assented to Lieberman’s intervention, and the Commonwealth did not object. The enforcement action judge nonetheless denied the motion, stating, “This court has already declined to take the public records action (09-2592A) into the [business litigation session] and intervention is unwarranted.”Lieberman appealed to the Appeals Court both the order denying intervention in the enforcement action and the judgment dismissing the public records action, and the Appeals Court granted a motion to consolidate the appeals.

The search warrant indicated that the police were looking for evidence of the use, sale, and distribution of narcotics, along with firearms and ammunition. The search warrant identified one man, Jeffrey Sickles, as a person to be searched. An attached police affidavit identified a woman — Ileen Sickles, the sister of the man named in the search warrant— who listed the residence as her home address.The officers involved in the search did not know Danielle Brown and had no facts associating Brown with the residence. In light of this lack of knowledge, it is not surprising that Brown’s name does not appear anywhere in the search warrant.Ten SWAT team officers executed the search warrant. They found Brown and four individuals in a bedroom of the house. The individuals were immediately handcuffed. Brown was handcuffed where the officers found her. The purse in question was next to Brown when she was handcuffed. Brown along with the others was taken by officers into a living room.Officer John Scarlet searched the purse. Inside the purse he found a zippered pouch. Upon opening the pouch, the officer found baggies. Upon opening the baggies, the officer found a small amount of marijuana.After being given Miranda warnings, Brown admitted she smoked methamphetamine and marijuana on a regular basis. She was arrested for possession of the marijuana found in her purse.Prior to trial, Brown filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of her purse under both the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, section 8 of the Iowa Constitution.

The restroom is freely accessible to members of the public, including children. Once in the restroom, Singson entered the handicapped bathroom stall and remained in that stall for approximately thirty minutes. Singson then left the handicap bathroom stall and approached a stall occupied by an undercover police officer. Singson “stopped in front of the stall, leaned forward,” and “peered into [the] stall through the crack in the stall door.” The undercover police officer, who was in “a state of undress,” asked Singson “What’s up?” and “What are you looking for?” Singson replied, “Cock.” The officer then asked “What do you want to do,” and Singson replied, “I want to suck cock.” The undercover officer asked if Singson wanted to suck his penis, and Singson responded, “Yes.” When the officer asked, “Do you want to do it in here,” Singson nodded towards the handicap stall. The officer then asked if Singson wanted to suck his penis in the handicap stall, and Singson responded, “Yes.”A grand jury indicted Singson for “command[ing], entreating] or otherwise attempting] to persuade another to commit a felony other than murder,” specifically, “Crimes Against Nature,” in violation of Code §§ 18.2-29 and 18.2-361. Singson moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that Code § 18.2-361 “is overbroad and vague, [and] violates the defendant’s rights to Due Process under the United States Constitution as outlined in the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion in [Lawrence v.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Not surprisingly the serious charges of widespread police wrongdoing, including murder allegations, piqued the attention and concern of the public. Accordingly, the media documented this two year drama with several hundred news reports. Though largely dispassionate, these accounts were occasionally punctuated by editorial remarks. In addition, these reports were disseminated by the major audio, video and print media sources which collectively reached the entire Dade County metropolitan area. Consequently, with two exceptions, all potential jurors recalled hearing something about the case. The extent and character of the veniremen’s knowledge, however, greatly varied.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"On October 8, 2003, Plaintiff Jarek Molski brought a complaint against Defendants for discrimination and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) Accessibility Guidelines and/or California’s Title 24 Building Code requirements. Plaintiff seeks an injunction under the ADA and monetary damages under state law. Plaintiff, who is confined to a wheelchair, claims to have visited Defendants’ premises, a gas station, to utilize their goods and services. Plaintiff alleges that he was discriminated against because Defendants’ facility was inaccessible to wheelchair users. Further, Plaintiff alleges he was denied full and equal access to other portions of the property, including but not limited to: inaccessible paths of travel, inaccessible parking, and inaccessible amenities, including the restroom. As Defendants have purportedly failed to make readily achievable modifications to provide disabled access, P contends he is entitled to relief.Defendants bring the instant motion to compel discovery responses that Defendants claim will help to determine whether or not Plaintiff has standing to bring this lawsuit in federal court. Defendants contend that Plaintiff, in truth, is attempting to act as a private attorney general, purposely visiting establishments just to be denied access. Defendants assert this is not the basis for establishing a “case” or “controversy” for federal standing purposes. They argue that Plaintiff brings this lawsuit for damages and injunc-tive relief, without ever intending to return to the subject establishment. Thus, Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not have standing in federal court because the ADA only provides the private remedy of injunc-tive relief, which remedy is not available to Plaintiff here because he does not intend to return to the Defendants’ establishment. To prove their argument, Defendants have requested the total sum of settlement monies Plaintiff has received in the past five years from similar lawsuits and file-stamped copies of all complaints Plaintiff has filed in federal or state court since January 1, 2002. Plaintiff has refused to provide this information. To compromise, Defendants offered to Plaintiff that they would only require copies of the first few pages of the complaints filed by Plaintiff in the last year. This compromise was rejected by Plaintiff. Consequently, Defendants brought this motion.I","{'Sender': 'Defendants', 'Sender Role': 'Legal representatives of the Defendants', 'Recipient': 'Plaintiff Jarek Molski', 'Recipient Role': 'Plaintiff', 'About': 'Plaintiff Jarek Molski', 'About Role': 'Plaintiff', 'Type': 'Legal complaint and discovery request', 'Purpose': ""To determine Plaintiff's standing to bring the lawsuit in federal court"", 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Defendants believe that Plaintiff is attempting to act as a private attorney general.'}"

The lead drug enforcement agent parked his car so that the headlights were directly shining on the primary entrance to the home, a locked door that entered into the garage. That door was the same door that the confidential informant, an acquaintance of Reynoso, had entered during the controlled buy.[¶ 3] Upon approaching the door, Agent Tony Milligan yelled that the “drug enforcement” or “police” were at the door.

After her arrest, Wilson was taken to the Shelby County Jail, where, due to the level of alcohol in her blood, she was required to remain until the following morning. Because the Shelby County Jail does not have separate facilities to hold temporary female detainees, Wilson was placed in a cell within the general female population of the jail.Before taking Wilson to her cell, a female corrections officer performed a strip search on Wilson pursuant to Policy Number B-103 of the Shelby County Jail, which requires each arrestee to undergo a “complete search” prior to admission into the general population of the jail. The officer escorted Wilson to an unoccupied restroom in the jail and, after allowing her to use the restroom, instructed her to disrobe completely, face the wall, squat, spread her buttocks, and cough three times. The officer also checked Wilson’s ears, mouth, nose and breasts during the search. She did not, however, do a visual or manual inspection of Wilson’s body cavities below the waist.Subsequently, Wilson brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Sheriff Jones, asserting that he violated her Fourth Amendment rights by creating and implementing the policy under which she was searched.

The brother’s girlfriend telephoned Defendant to tell him about the dispute. Defendant then drove to his brother’s house. After Defendant arrived at his brother’s house, he exited his vehicle and began to speak with his brother and the neighbors. Several minutes later, at approximately 7:32 p.m., the police also arrived on the scene.Soon thereafter, the firearm in question was seized after a warrantless search of Defendant’s vehicle. This warrantless search was conducted by Officer John Newcomer of the Mount Morris Township Police Department. Officer Newcomer claims that he sought and obtained Defendant’s consent to search the vehicle. Defendant, however, avers that he did not consent to the search. Moreover, Defendant maintains that he was never asked to give his consent.Officer Newcomer located the firearm next to the driver’s seat underneath a pillow. Defendant was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and was transported to the Mount Morris Township Police Department for questioning. At approximately 8:19 p.m., Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and signed a form consenting to give a statement to the police. Thereafter, Defendant confessed to owning the firearm in question. He admitted that he purchased it two weeks before the arrest for approximately $50.00. He further admitted that he placed the firearm in the vehicle.Afterwards, Officer Newcomer composed a detailed incident report recounting all the events of that evening. Importantly, this report did not include any indication that Officer Newcomer, or any other officer, received Defendant’s consent to search the vehicle. Furthermore, there is not even a hint that Officer Newcomer, or any other officer, sought Defendant’s consent.Some four months later, a state prosecutor on the case found some discrepancies in Officer Newcomer’s report. As a result, the prosecutor declined to issue an arrest warrant at that time, and Officer Newcomer was asked to clarify certain issues in the report. On November 21, 2001, Officer Newcomer submitted a supplemental report clarifying two issues. First, the supplemental report stated that Officer Newcomer asked Defendant if the police could check Defendant’s vehicle and that Defendant responded in the affirmative. Second, it identified the brother-neighbor dispute as the source of the trouble on the night in question.","{'Sender': ""Defendant's girlfriend"", 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Defendant', 'Recipient Role': 'None', 'About': ""Dispute between Defendant's brother and neighbors"", 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Verbal communication', 'Purpose': 'Informing Defendant about the dispute', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

In March, 2014, the Commonwealth moved under Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.8 (f), 426 Mass. 1397 (1998), for judicial approval of a grand jury subpoena compelling the law firm to produce the telephone. A Superior Court judge held a hearing on the motion and issued a ruling from the bench, followed by a written decision a few days thereafter. The judge denied the motion, but noted that his denial was without prejudice to refiling. The judge indicated that, if he determined upon such refiling that the Commonwealth had, through an ex parte proceeding, established probable cause sufficient to justify a search under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, he would allow the Commonwealth to issue a subpoena compelling the law firm to produce the telephone. At a subsequent hearing, the judge allowed the Commonwealth’s second motion for judicial approval of the grand jury subpoena directed at the law firm, but stayed issuance and execution of the subpoena to allow Doe to file a petition for relief in the county court pursuant to G.

While the investigation did not discover any illegal drug sales, it did uncover a number of other unsavory activities by public works employees. These discoveries led to a round of disciplinings and dismissals in the department.As part of these dismissals, on June 4, 1993 Doe was notified by Human Resources Director Smith that he was terminated because he had failed a drug test. Further, Doe alleges that Smith told him the information regarding the reason for his dismissal would remain confidential. According to the Personnel Manual for Oak Park, an employee’s personnel file and disciplinary reports are to remain confidential.However, on August 23,1993, Village Manager Parker held a press conference outlining the undercover investigation and the subsequent termination of certain employees, including Doe. Despite any assurance of confidentiality, Parker disclosed the reason for Doe’s termination at the press conference. These statements were reported in at least three articles that ran in two local newspapers, the Wednesday Journal and The Oak Leaves. The articles explicitly refer to Doe being fired for his failure to pass a drug test, but do not discuss any further investigation of Doe or any allegation of criminal activity.On March 14, 1994, plaintiff brought this three count complaint against the Village, Parker and Smith.

After a hearing, a magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation (“R & R”), recommending that Wilcox’s motion to suppress be denied. The R & R concluded that Wilcox had no expectation of privacy in the license plate, which was displayed in plain view on the public roads.The R & R, which was filed on December 22, 2009, advised the parties that they had fourteen days to file objections and that the failure to object would limit appellate review to plain error.

Croslan could only be terminated for good cause under that agreement.Plaintiffs responsibility was to oversee NBHA’s day-to-day operations. However, the powers of NBHA are vested in a Board of Commissioners. When plaintiff was first employed by NBHA, the Board consisted of Connie Wilson Collins (“Collins”), Charles W. Kerr, Peter Tomassetti, Ronald Davis and Thelma Santiago-Phillips.Plaintiff alleges that in or about October 1993, she received a memorandum from Collins regarding renewal of her contract. A cover note indicated that her contract would be voted on at the next Board meeting, but that it could not be put on the agenda. The memorandum outlined an offer, including an eight percent pay increase, and an increase in vacation and life insurance. Attached to the memorandum was a “board narrative” which made suggestions for and criticisms of Croslan’s job performance.On November 13, 1993, the minutes of the Board meeting reflect a motion to renew Croslan’s contract was approved, subject to “some discussion that has to be cleared up with the Executive Director.” The minutes do not describe the contract terms. Croslan then wrote a memorandum directing NBHA’s Finance Department to implement an eight percent pay increase retroactive to February 19,1993, the date her original two-year term expired.In November 1993, Linda Blogoslawski (“Blogoslawski”) became mayor of New Britain and appointed Dilzer, her executive aide, O’Keefe and Landrau to replace Collins, Tomassetti and Kerr (“New Board”).

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"From September 2006 to December 2008, Jiau operated an insider trading scheme that involved a pair of tippers who worked at publicly-traded companies, Son Ngoc Nguyen of NVIDIA Corporation and Stanley Ng of Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., and a pair of tippees who were hedge fund managers, Samir Barai of Tribeca Capital Management and later Barai Capital Management (“BCM”) and Noah Freeman of Sonar Capital Management and later SAC Capital. Jiau worked as a contract employee at NVIDIA and as a consultant who provided information about the semiconductor industry to financial analysts. At each of those jobs, she was aware of the rules against disclosing material non-public information.Jiau’s scheme was to obtain from her tippers earnings data of their employer companies and convey this data to her tippees before those companies’ quarterly financial results were publicly released. The tippees compared the data with Wall Street analysts’ published expectations and unpublished rumors known as the “whisper.” If the data indicated that earnings would fail to meet expectations, the tippees would “go short” by selling their stock positions in the companies before the financial reports were made public. If the data showed that earnings would likely exceed Wall Street’s expectations, the tip-pees would “go long” by buying the stock.To provide an incentive, Jiau promised the tippers insider information for their own private trading. She also engaged in her own insider trading. After a three-week trial, a jury convicted Jiau of conspiracy to engage in insider trading and one substantive count of insider trading. On September 21, 2011, the district court sentenced her to 48 months’ imprisonment and ordered a forfeiture of $3,118 million.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In January, 1995, defendant Antonio Gonzalez became a target of the Eastern Hampden County Narcotics Task Force, a local police collaborative directed at drug dealing in Western Massachusetts. The investigation, which lasted about nine months, gathered information from informants about suspicious behavior by defendant and included surveillance of possible drug-related activity at his home, 450 Mon-son Road in Wilbraham, Massachusetts.In September 1995, Sergeant Roger Tucker, a member of the Task Force, applied for a warrant to search defendant’s home. The affidavit accompanying the application included detailed evidence that defendant was dealing cocaine. Sergeant Tucker described a series of “trash pulls” — searches of trash bags from the house — that turned up torn portions of small plastic baggies with cocaine residue inside. He also reported suspicious behavior by defendant that had been reported to police by informants.The warrant application included a request for permission to enter the premises unannounced — what is known as a “no-knock” entry. This section of the affidavit relied heavily on what the officer believed to be “the common practiee[s] of narcotic dealers,” namely, their tendency to destroy narcotics when the police announce themselves, to keep weapons along with their drugs, to hide drugs on individuals unlikely to be searched, such as children, and to use lookouts or “police scanning devices” to forewarn them of officers’ presence. See Docket No. 30, Ex. A (Tucker Aff.) at 4. Sergeant Tucker also stated that because the Monson Road address had a “lengthy driveway” with windows facing the street, no-knock entry was required to ensure the “element of surprise.” See id. In another section of the affidavit, Tucker mentioned in passing that Gonzalez owned a Rottweiler dog.The clerk-magistrate of the Palmer District Court approved the warrant application and the request for no-knock entry. Although the warrant allowed seizure of all weapons at the address, Sergeant Tucker testified that at the time of the application he had no knowledge of any weapons there and did not expect to find any. The focus of the search was drugs.On the evening of September 30, 1995, the Task Force executed the warrant on 450 Monson Road, breaking down the front door and entering with guns drawn. After arresting defendant and his girlfriend, they found a 9 mm handgun, ammunition, small amounts of marijuana, and other evidence of drug dealing. The handgun and ammunition form the basis of the current charges against defendant: possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Defendant was taken into custody and, while he was held at the Wilbraham Police Department, made certain arguably inculpatory statements about drug dealing and the gun.I","{'Sender': 'Sergeant Roger Tucker', 'Sender Role': 'Member of Eastern Hampden County Narcotics Task Force', 'Recipient': 'Clerk-Magistrate of Palmer District Court', 'Recipient Role': 'Court official', 'About': 'Antonio Gonzalez', 'About Role': 'Suspect', 'Type': 'Information related to drug dealing and criminal activity', 'Purpose': ""Requesting a warrant to search Gonzalez's home"", 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Gonzalez was involved in drug dealing and had a weapon in his possession'}"

He lived and worked in the United States illegally until he met with a California attorney, Roberto Fernandez, in 2001 to “fix his status” through an asylum application. Even though Gonzalez was living in New Mexico, he followed the attorney’s instructions to put the attorney’s California mailing address on the application to ensure that the attorney would receive important court documents through the mail. By signing the application, Gonzalez swore that its contents were either “all true or not all true.”At an interview with an asylum officer in March 2001, Gonzalez testified that he had lived in southern California since December 2000, despite having signed a declaration in which he swore to tell the truth during his interview. The officer’s notes specifically indicate the oath was administered. Nevertheless, the officer concluded that Gonzalez was ineligible for asylum and referred his case to an immigration judge (“IJ”).Gonzalez appeared before an IJ and conceded removability, withdrew his asylum application, and sought relief in the form of cancellation of removal or voluntary departure. Gonzalez testified before the IJ that he had told the asylum officer during his March 2001 interview that he had lived in California since December 2000, even though he was actually living in New Mexico. He also testified that the asylum officer had asked if the information in the application was correct, and that he had answered yes, even though he knew the address was incorrect. Gonzalez recounted that he had put the attorney’s California address on the application at the attorney’s direction.On April 19, 2004, the IJ denied cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, concluding that Gonzalez could not show good moral character because he gave false testimony at the asylum hearing in March 2001 with the subjective intent of obtaining immigration benefits. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ’s opinion on August 2, 2005. Gonzalez now petitions for review in this court.II.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"This is a Fourth Amendment case. Bellamy-Bey alleges that several Baltimore City Police Officers stopped him without reasonable suspicion and ordered him to produce identification. When he refused, the officers forcibly removed Bellamy-Bey from his car and detained him while they conducted a search and determined whether there were any outstanding warrants.Bellamy-Bey requested copies of all police files relating to claims brought against the Defendant police officers. The Defendants refused to produce the documents arguing that the files are confidential. The Court has reviewed the files in camera, and the parties have briefed whether the documents should be produced.Of the twenty-nine claims, seven are factually similar to Bellamy-Bey’s allegations. These claims can be divided into three categories: (1) sustained, (2) transferred, and (3) unsustained. Only one claim was sustained., (Claim 99-3801). This claim involved two officers, one of whom is a named defendant. The Baltimore Police Department Internal Investigation Division (IID) concluded that the defendant violated police rules and regulations by stopping a man, grabbing him by the jaw, forcing him into the air, and searching him. The file states that, as a result of the claim, the officers were subject to the agency’s disciplinary procedures.Another claim was transferred from IID to the Special Operations Division. (Claim 02-R0984). Claims are transferred when IID determines that the “complaint involves minor misconduct that is most appropriately handled by the officer’s District Commander.” (BPD’s Bench Memo., Ex. 1, 116). The transferred claim involves an officer who grabbed a man by the collar as he was walking along the sidewalk. The officer searched the man and asked for identification. When the man provided identification, the officer left the scene.Five of the claims were unsustained. (Claims 05-082, 04-548, 01-0806, 00-869 and 95-829). Of these, two were unsustained because IID concluded that the claims were not accurate or truthful. (Claims 00-689 and 95-892). The other three were unsustained because the claimants did not cooperate or did not file a formal complaint.

Detectives arrived at defendant’s house to find that defendant was not present. Furthermore, execution of the search warrant yielded no evidence.Thereafter, the police contacted defendant’s place of employment, the Raleigh Fire Department, Spring Forest Road Station, in order to locate defendant. Defendant, who was at the station, was notified that police were going to arrest him. Opting to avoid arrest at the fire station, a senior fire official drove defendant to the Raleigh police substation on Litchford Road, at which point defendant was taken into custody.After being taken into custody, defendant was read his Miranda rights. Defendant initially indicated that he was unsure whether he wanted an attorney. But when the detective responded that he could not tell him anything further than what was on the arrest warrant and would have to take him back to Guilford County, defendant proceeded to waive his rights.During questioning, detectives elicited statements from defendant by telling him that the more he helped them, the more they could help him; and that if he was cooperative, they would inform the court and the district attorney that he had been cooperative.

The agents went to the branch and arranged for one of the tellers to give a hand signal when Moody arrived. At approximately two o’clock that afternoon, Moody arrived at the bank and transacted her business. The agents observed her walk to a shopping center parking lot, where a motor home bearing Colorado license plates eventually pulled up. The plates indicated issuance of a vehicle license to a handicapped owner. The officers knew Wiga was not handicapped.After following the motor home for roughly 15 minutes, Barry pulled alongside in an attempt to identify the driver. Barry determined that the driver closely resembled Wiga. At about the time that Barry pulled alongside, the driver pulled down the left-hand sun screen in what Barry surmised was an attempt to hide his face. Barry then pulled the motor home over to the side of the road. Barry and T’Kindt, after identifying themselves, ordered the driver to step out. They concluded upon closer inspection that the driver indeed was Wiga.After arresting and handcuffing Wiga, Barry asked if anyone else was in the motor home. Wiga replied that no one else was inside, a statement the agents knew was untrue because they had seen Moody enter earlier. T’Kindt called for Moody to come out, which she did via the rear door. Moody had not been visible to the agents since she had entered.After Moody complied, T’Kindt entered the rear door of the motor home to see if any confederates of Wiga might still be inside. T’Kindt briefly walked toward the front of the 20-foot vehicle, checking both the bathroom and the closet for possible occupants. As he neared the front, he noticed lying on the floor to the rear of the driver’s seat a .357 magnum revolver, and also saw a shotgun in an overhead bunk section above the driver’s compartment. He took custody of both weapons, each of which was loaded.Wiga moved to suppress the weapons on fourth amendment grounds in a pretrial motion.

Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979). The Court reasoned that pen registers do not implicate the Fourth Amendment because there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in the information they collect. Id. at 744, 99 S.Ct. 2577.

Today, Americans regularly use their telephones not just to dial a phone number, but to manage bank accounts, refill prescriptions, check movie times, and so on.Dialed digits can now be categorized in a number of ways. “Post-cut-through dialed digits” (“PCTDD”), the subject of the instant application, “are any numbers dialed from a telephone after the call is initially setup or ‘cut-through.’ ” In re U.S. (S.D.Tex.), 441 F.Supp.2d at 818. In most instances, any digit dialed after the first ten is a PCTDD. “Sometimes these digits transmit real information, such as bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, prescription numbers, and the like.” Id In such circumstances, PCTDD contain the “contents of communication.” Id. (citing U.S. Telecom, 227 F.3d at 462). At other times, PCTDD “are other telephone numbers, as when a party places a credit card call by first dialing the long distance carrier access number and then the phone number of the intended party,” id, or when an extension number is dialed.At issue are the parameters of the federal statute governing pen registers. The Government contends that pen register authorization entitles it to all digits dialed from a target telephone, including PCTDD that may include content. The Government maintains that federal law requires it only to minimize the collection of content using reasonably available technology. If no technology exists that can sort content from non-content, the Government argues it is entitled to access all digits dialed subject only to Department of Justice (“DOJ”) guidelines, which forbid the use of content gathered with a pen register absent extenuating circumstances, and federal wiretap laws. (See Gov. Supp. Mem. of Law 12-16.) For the sake of clarity, I will refer to the Government’s position as the “minimization theory.” Because the Government’s position belies statutory interpretation and would violate the Fourth Amendment, the application is denied.","{'Sender': 'None', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'None', 'Recipient Role': 'None', 'About': 'Individuals whose telephone activities are being monitored', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Telephone digits, including Post-cut-through dialed digits (PCTDD)', 'Purpose': 'Government surveillance and investigation', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

She alleged violations of her Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. She averred that she was detained for 39 days on warrants issued in Georgia, nine days longer than the 30 days allowed by 18 U.S.C. § 3182. She further alleged that Captain Greene, the jail official in charge of releasing prisoners, told her that intervening weekends and holidays did not count in the 30-day calculation. Ms. Lewis also claimed that her conditions of confinement at the jail were inhumane.McKinley County filed a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Ms. Lewis responded. In a thorough order, the district court granted the motion and dismissed the ease with prejudice, noting that the language of 18 U.S.C. § 3182 is permissive rather than mandatory. Even if § 3182 required Ms. Lewis’s release after 30 days, the court said she failed to allege facts under which McKinley County could be held liable for the allegedly wrongful actions of Captain Greene. The court further ruled that Ms. Lewis’s allegations concerning jail conditions did not describe deprivations that were sufficiently serious to state a claim, nor did she plead facts showing that McKinley County was deliberately indifferent to the jail conditions.","{'Sender': 'Captain Greene', 'Sender Role': 'Jail Official', 'Recipient': 'Ms. Lewis', 'Recipient Role': 'Detainee', 'About': 'Ms. Lewis', 'About Role': 'Detainee', 'Type': 'Legal information', 'Purpose': 'Informing Ms. Lewis about the 30-day calculation for detention warrants', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Landham is a fringe actor who has played supporting roles in several motion pictures, including 48 Hours, Action Jackson, and Maximum Force, as well as several unrated, pornographic films. This suit concerns the role of “Billy, the Native American Tracker” that Landham portrayed in Fox’s 1987 action film Predator. Landham’s employment was initially memorialized in a March 3, 1986, “Standard Cast Deal Memo” (“Memo”), which detailed only the salary, starting date, and an agreement that Landham would pay for a bodyguard for himself. Fox later delivered a “Deal Player Employment Agreement” (“Agreement”) which, among other things, assigned all merchandising rights for the Billy character to Fox. The Agreement was never signed, however, and there is a dispute between the parties as to how long after Landham left for filming in Mexico the Agreement was received by his agent in the United States. Landham testified that the only contractual understanding he had with Fox was that he would act in the movie for a specified amount of money and that he would be required to pay for the bodyguard. In 1995, Fox licensed to Galoob the rights to produce and market a line of its “Micro Machines” toys based on Predator. One of these three sets of toys contained a “Billy” action figure. Because the toy is only 1.5 inches tall and has no eyes or mouth, it bears no personal resemblance to Landham. Moreover, Eric Shank, the Galoob employee who designed the toy, purposefully avoided any such resemblance. Nonetheless, Landham argues that the toy violates his right of publicity under Kentucky law and amounts to a false endorsement under the Lanham Act. The district court disagreed, finding insufficient evidence to suggest that consumers would associate the toy with Landham.","{'Sender': 'Fox', 'Sender Role': 'Employer', 'Recipient': 'Landham', 'Recipient Role': 'Employee', 'About': 'Landham', 'About Role': 'Actor', 'Type': 'Merchandising rights', 'Purpose': 'Employment agreement', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Landham', 'Belief': 'None'}"

He filed a section 1983 action against Johnston, his correctional counsel- or, in May 1985 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Hernandez sought injunctive relief and $60,000 in both actual and exemplary damages. He stated his claim as follows:Comments such as ‘violent,’ ‘criminal record,’ ‘need for structured setting’ all give rise to negative ongoing implications, that can have negative legal, social, psychological, financial, etc., effects on the person to whom they are attached. ...I want the court to put a stop to the prison policy of using pseudo-legalistic, psychological, etc., terms against prisoners, without due process findings of records ....Hernandez’ suit centers on the “violent offender” status noted in his Washington Department of Corrections “Classification Referral/Progress Report.” Hernandez contends that since his burglary offense was nonviolent, the classification is incorrect. A written request to have the notation removed from his prison file was denied in December 1985.Johnston, who is in charge of Hernandez’ file, stated in an affidavit that “violent offender” status is based on an inmate’s criminal history, not his current offense. Johnston said he designated Hernandez as violent because of two prior convictions for battery, one for attempted forcible rape, and one for assault with a deadly weapon, listed on Hernandez’ FBI “Rap Sheet.”Hernandez was granted permission in March 1986 to join MICC officials Tom Ahearn, Jim Rogers, John McCain, Chuck Houser, Al Scamahorn, Dan Snyder, William Callahan, and Bob Benn as defendants in his section 1983 suit. While the action was pending, Hernandez filed a “directed verdict” motion in the district court.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Sgt. Schaub of the St. Paul Police Department, a member of the Minnesota Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (“MICAC”), was contacted by a mother (“DL”) because of a document she retrieved from her family’s computer. This document contained a partial log of a dialogue between her son (“AM”), who is a minor, and a party using the name “dlbchl5.” In the dialogue, “dlbehl5” asked AM where to hide an object near AM’s house and if AM wanted to see him again. When questioned about this dialogue, AM told law enforcement that it had occurred in a “chat room” on www.yahoo.com and that “dlbchl5” was going to hide Playboy magazines for AM. AM said he had met “dlbchl5” in person, but he denied any sexual contact between them.Schaub investigated this incident, discovered that “dlbehl5” was Bach and that he had been convicted of criminal sexual conduct in 1996. Eventually, Schaub obtained a state search warrant to retrieve from Yahoo! e-mails between the defendant and possible victims of criminal sexual conduct, as well as the Internet Protocol addresses connected to his account. Both the warrant itself and Schaub’s affidavit indicated that the warrant could be faxed to Yahoo! in compliance with section 1524.2 of the California Penal Code. Schaub faxed the signed warrant to Yahoo!.Yahoo! technicians retrieved all of the information from Bach’s account at dlbchl5@yahoo.com and AM’s Yahoo! email account. According to Yahoo!, when executing warrants, technicians do not selectively choose or review the contents of the named account. The information retrieved from Bach and AM’s accounts was either loaded onto a zip disc or printed and sent to Schaub. E-mails recovered from Bach’s account detail him exchanging pictures with other boys and meeting with them. One e-mail contained a picture of a naked boy. The information retrieved from Yahoo! also included Bach’s address, date of birth, telephone number, and other screen names.Investigators then obtained a search warrant for Bach’s house, where they seized a computer, discs, a digital camera, and evidence of child pornography. Based on this information, and the information obtained from Yahoo!, Bach was indicted for possession, transmission, receipt, and manufacturing of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A(a)(1) and (2), 2252A(a)(5), 2252A(b)(2), 2252(a)(4), 2252(a)(1) and (2), 2252(b)(2), 2251(a) and (d), and 2253(a).

Joann Yazzie (Defendant) was driving a vehicle on November 23, 2010, when Officer James Rempe entered its license plate number into the mobile data terminal (MDT) in his police car, which informed him that Defendant’s vehicle insurance status was “unknown.” He then executed a traffic stop. Defendant entered a conditional plea in the magistrate court for driving under the influence, reserving the question of whether her stop was based on reasonable suspicion and, upon her conviction, appealed her case de novo to the district court. In the district court, the State stipulated that “the only basis for the stop in this case was Officer Rempe’s receiving information from [MVD] that. . . the status of the vehicle’s insurance was unknown.” In the district court, Defendant again moved to have her stop ruled unconstitutional because the officer lacked sufficient facts to justify seizing her.{3} It appears that the State’s strategy in this case was to establish grounds for proving the meaning of “unknown” insurance status. At the beginning of the suppression hearing, the prosecutor stated that the State sought a witness from the MVD to testify about what “unknown” insurance status would mean in order to quell a recurring issue. The district court agreed and stated:I think the State’s looking for this expert based on my previous decisions that insurance unknown just doesn’t cut it to me. I think it needs to be more, and I think the State’s following my previous directive that if they don’t have more, I’m going to be suppressing these stops.The State called a witness from the MVD, who testified that there was a high likelihood that “unknown” insurance status may mean “uninsured.” From this evidence, the district court concluded that “[gjiven the 80% to 90% chance that the owner of a vehicle with an unknown insurance status has not yet obtained evidence of financial responsibility for the vehicle, it was reasonable for Officer Rempe to suspect that. . . Defendant did not have evidence of financial responsibility for her vehicle as she drove it on November 23, 2010.” Defendant does not contest the MVD witness’s opinion regarding the likelihood that unknown status correlates with uninsured vehicles, but asserts that the correlation is irrelevant to the central question of whether the officer had reasonable suspicion at the time of the stop. No evidence was ever presented to the court as to what the officer suspected, or did not suspect, about “unknown” insurance status. The district court held the stop to be constitutionally valid, and Defendant appealed.","{'Sender': 'Mobile data terminal (MDT)', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement officer', 'Recipient': 'Officer James Rempe', 'Recipient Role': 'Law enforcement officer', 'About': 'Joann Yazzie', 'About Role': 'Driver', 'Type': 'Insurance status', 'Purpose': 'Traffic stop', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Officer Rempe lacked sufficient facts to justify seizing Yazzie'}"

Lavin activated the lights on his cruiser, and followed behind the automobile. The automobile traveled between fifty to one hundred yards, less than one block, before stopping in the parking lot of a multi-unit residential building. The parking lot was well lit. Lavin parked approximately ten feet behind the automobile and called for backup. He saw two male passengers, Hendricks and Cherry, leave the automobile and walk toward the building. Lavin ordered both men to get back into the automobile. One of the men began running toward the building, while the other hastened his pace.Perkins, the driver of the automobile, remained seated and identified himself to Lavin. Lavin ordered Perkins out of the automobile and pat frisked him. Lavin asked Perkins for identification and for the names of the passengers who had left the scene. Perkins said that he did not know the passengers. He produced a learner’s permit, which required him to have a licensed driver with him while operating an automobile. See G. L. c. 90, § 8B. Lavin again asked Perkins to identify the passengers, but Perkins made no response. At that point, Lavin handcuffed Perkins.Officer Timothy Segur of the Worcester police department arrived at the scene within three minutes of receiving Lavin’s call for assistance. After Lavin related the events summarized above, Segur entered the building and checked the first-floor common areas, including the hallway. He was inside thp building for less than one minute before returning to the automobile. Segur asked Lavin if he had searched the automobile, and Lavin said, “No.” The driver’s side door was ajar, and the interior light was on. The officers did not observe any contraband in plain view. However, upon conducting a search of the interior of the automobile, the officers found a firearm, marijuana, and a substance believed to be “crack” cocaine.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Plaintiff is a limited liability company that produces copyrighted adult films. Defendant is alleged to have used the BitTorrent file distribution network to download adult pornographic films subject to copyrights held by Plaintiff. Defendant has been identified in this lawsuit only by an Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”) assigned to a customer on a specific date by an Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) and through which the copyrighted works were allegedly downloaded.BitTorrent technology has been described by several courts, including the district court in Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, No. 15-cv-4369 (AKH), 2015 WL 4092417, *1-2 (S.D.N.Y. July 6, 2015):BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol that allows users to transfer large files over the internet by breaking the complete file (the “Seed”) into small pieces to be downloaded in parts. Other users (“Peers”) downloaded a small “torrent” file that contains an index of the pieces and directions for connecting to the Seed. When Peers connect to the Seed, they download pieces of the file at random, and begin sharing each piece once it has completed downloading. After all the pieces are downloaded, the BitTorrent software reassembles the pieces into a complete file for the Peer to view.BitTorrent is distinguishable from other file sharing protocols by its users’ ability to upload and download files simultaneously. This non-sequential download structure reduces the bottleneck of traffic, which allows for faster download speeds. The Peers that are uploading and downloading the same Seed file from each other at a given point in time are collectively called a “Swarm.” Members of a Swarm are able to see the IP addresses of other Peers to whom they are connected. In addition, Bit-Torrent “tracks” the pieces of a file as it is shared, so Peers can identify the IP addresses from which the file was downloaded.Id. (citing Patrick Collins, Inc. v.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"A. The Registry ActOn December 27, 2011, Puerto Rico Governor Luis Fortufio signed into law the Registry Act. According to the Act’s explanatory statement, while many individuals legitimately purchase prepaid phones to avoid signing burdensome contracts or paying for unnecessary service, the criminal use of such phones has become widespread in Puerto Rico. See Registry Act, pmbl. The Registry Act was thus created to address the “problem ... that the owners of these mobile units, because they are pre-paid, are not registered by the various companies, making it impossible for the authorities to track down their owners” in the event the phone is used to commit a criminal offense like extortion. Id.To combat this problem, the Registry Act instructs the Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Puerto Rico (the “Board”), a government agency tasked with regulating telecommunications services in Puerto Rico, to create and maintain a registry of prepaid cell phone numbers. Id. §§ 3-5. To ensure that the Board is provided with the information it needs to create a registry, the Act requires that:Every telephone company, natural or legal person, or business entity that sells a pre-paid mobile telephone unit shall require photo identification at the time of purchase and shall register with the Board the name and physical and postal address of the owner of the unit and an alternative telephone number, the number of the unit, its make, model, and serial number.Id. § 5. This information must be provided to the Board within thirty days of purchase, and the penalty for failing to do so is a fine of up to $25,000 for each violation. Id. § 8.B. Procedural historyPlaintiff-Appellee CTIA — The Wireless Association (“CTIA”) is a non-profit corporation that represents the interests of the wireless communications industry. CTIA’s members include Sprint, AT & T, T-Mobile, and others who sell prepaid cell phones in Puerto Rico. On February 15, 2012, CTIA sued the Board, three of the Board’s members in their official capacities, and Governor Fortuño in his official capacity (collectively, the “Appellants”). CTIA sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the Registry Act was preempted by the SCA because the SCA prohibits CTIA’s members from turning over to the government — without a subpoena — the same information that the Registry Act requires them to provide.Appellants moved to dismiss the complaint, and the district court denied the motion to dismiss on August 2, 2012, adopting the magistrate judge’s recommendation and finding that the two laws clearly conflict. The district court determined that the plain language of the SCA prohibits the disclosure of cell-phone customer information in the manner that the Registry Act requires. The district court then referred back to the magistrate judge the question whether the court should permanently enjoin the enforcement of the Registry Act. On October 18, 2012, the district court adopted the magistrate judge’s findings and recommendations and granted CTIA’s motion for a permanent injunction.

After receiving the e-mail, the scoutmaster alerted the Bronxville police, as well as Lunney’s scoutmaster. They investigated the matter, and readily accepted Lunney’s denial of authorship, and his innocence in this episode.While the investigation was afoot, Prodigy, by letter dated September 14, 1994, notified Lunney that it was terminating one of the named accounts “due to the transmission of obscene, abusive, threatening, and sexually explicit material through the Prodigy service and providing inaccurate profile information.” Lunney, for his part, advised Prodigy that it was an imposter who, without authority, had opened the account and sent the message. Prodigy apologized to Lunney and also informed him that it had uncovered four more Alexander Lunney accounts and closed them all within two days after they were opened.Lunney sued Prodigy, claiming, in essence, that Prodigy was derelict in allowing the accounts to be opened in his name, and was responsible for his having been stigmatized and defamed. During discovery Prodigy located and produced two additional vulgar messages that appeared on its electronic bulletin board with Alexander Lunney’s name as sender dated September 5, 1994 and September 7, 1994. Prodigy also produced two internal memoranda pertaining to Prodigy’s initial reasons for terminating the “Alexander Lunney” accounts before learning that they had been opened by an unauthorized imposter.Supreme Court denied Prodigy’s three motions for summary judgment. On a consolidated appeal from the denial of the second and third motions, the Appellate Division reversed and granted summary judgment to Prodigy, holding that (i) the messages were not “of and concerning” Lunney and therefore did not defame him, (ii) although the messages were in extremely poor taste, the stigma associated with them did not amount to defamation and (iii) Prodigy was not the publisher of the messages, but even if it could be so considered, it was entitled to a qualified privilege sheltering it from liability (see, Lunney v Prodigy Servs. Co., 250 AD2d 230, 233).

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"The rather brief factual background to this action is as follows: Structure, Inc. (“Structure”), is a clothing retailer that issued a store credit card account to Levine. This account was operated through a financial affiliate of Structure, World Financial National Network Bank (“WFNNB”). Levine paid the account in full and closed it sometime in 1998. The fact that the account was paid in full and voluntarily closed by Levine was shown on his Experian credit report.In May 2002 and again in August 2002, despite the fact that the Structure account had been closed for several years, Experi-an sold Levine’s credit report to Structure. Structure had informed Experian that it wanted the report for “account review” purposes. Structure reported no changes in Levine’s account to Experian, and Levine made no communications to Experian or Structure regarding the closed account.On 10 May 2004, Levine filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Experian, Structure, and WFNNB. On 8 November 2004, the district court granted Experian’s motion to dismiss and Structure and WFNNB’s motion to dismiss. In granting Experian’s motion, the district court stated that “FCRA does not suggest that a credit report may only be permissibly obtained for account review during particular points in the parties’ relationship” and further commented that Experian had no duty to investigate a facially valid request for a consumer report.

The court ultimately held that Levine’s “stand alone claim of emotional distress” was too “amorphous to support his demand for damages” and that he had not alleged “any objectively verifiable harm.” Id. at 15.

Huon pleaded not guilty, claimed that the encounter was consensual, and was acquitted by a jury. On the day Huon was acquitted, the legal website Above the Law (ATL) published an article entitled, “Rape Potpourri” (ATL article). The article discussed two “rape stories,” one of which concerned Jane Doe’s allegations and Huon’s opening statement at his criminal trial. At some point after its initial publication, the ATL article was updated to note that Huon was acquitted.One year after publication of the ATL article, Huon filed suit against ATL, alleging defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false light invasion of privacy. Several days later, the website Jezebel published an article entitled, “Acquitted Rapist Sues Blog for Calling Him Serial Rapist” (Jezebel article). The article superimposed Huon’s 2008 mugshot onto the ATL article and briefly explained the circumstances of Huon’s criminal trial and subsequent lawsuit against ATL. The article’s title was later changed to read, “Man Acquitted of Sexual Assault Sues Blog for Calling Him Serial Rapist” (emphasis added), but otherwise remained the same. The Jezebel article generated over 80 comments from anonymous third-party users.Huon amended his complaint in response to the publication of the Jezebel article, adding several new allegations and nearly a dozen new defendants, including Irin Carmon, the Jezebel article’s author; Gawker Media, Jezebel’s then-owner; and Nick Denton, Gawker’s founder (Gawker Defendants). After Huon amended his complaint several additional times to cure certain jurisdictional defects, the Gawker Defendants moved to dismiss Huon’s fourth amended complaint.The district judge granted the motion in full. He rejected Huon’s defamation claims as to the third-party user comments, finding insufficient allegations that Gawker employees had actually authored the comments, and concluding that the Communications Decency Act protects online publishers like Gawker from third-party comments. The judge also dismissed Huon’s defamation per se claim, finding that the Article’s headline was protected by the innocent construction rule and its text by the fair report privilege, and concluded that Huon had failed to plead the requisite special damages to maintain his defamation per quod claim. In addition, the judge dismissed Huon’s false-light and intentional-infliction claims, noting that the failure of his defamation claims was dispositive.

See Affidavit of Noah M. Weissman, January 26, 1995 (“Weissman Aff.”), Exhibit C: Inmate Misbehavior Report.

See ECF No. 95 (Mot.) at 2 n.l; ECF No. 146 (Corps Opp.) at 2. Upon further consideration, Dakota Access narrowed its concern to eleven documents. See Mot. at 2 & n.l. It filed a Motion for a Protective Order on February 1, 2017, asking the Court to withhold portions of those documents from public disclosure.The eleven documents at issue fall into three categories:(1) a set of five documents entitled “Spill Model Discussion,” prepared for five different pipeline locations (two in North Dakota and three in Illinois); (2) a set of five corresponding geographic response plans; and (3) a single prevention and response plan prepared by Dakota Access’s Horizontal Directional Drilling contractor.ECF No. 161 (Reply) at 3. Within those documents, Dakota Access asks the Court to protect “geographic information that specifically details pipeline infrastructure routes through private land” and “spill response information that specifically details pipeline features, capacity, flow rate, transportation, and related emergency response information, safeguards, and plans in certain sensitive locations along the [DAPL] route.” Mot. at 2. Dakota Access believes that the information “pinpoints locations where intentional damage to an oil pipeline would generate the greatest harm, and ... reveals in great detail the manner in which the authorities would try to respond to that damage.” Id. at 1. It therefore worries that “terrorists or others with ... malicious intent” will use the information to damage the pipeline in ways that maximize environmental harm.

See Compl ¶¶ 1-6. Plaintiffs also allege that the City did this in furtherance of an ongoing practice and policy of ridding the area of its homeless population. Compl. ¶¶ 4, 6, 19, 24.Plaintiffs expect that the City will “continue these practices of confiscating and immediately destroying the property of homeless individuals from the public streets and sidewalks without a warrant and without notice.” Compl. ¶ 50. On April 22, 2010, this Court issued a temporary restraining order (the “April TRO”) enjoining Defendant’s purportedly unconstitutional practices. See Dkt. # 11 (hereinafter “TRO”). At the same time, the Court ordered the parties to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. Pending before the Court is that Order to Show Cause.II. Legal StandardA party seeking a preliminary injunction must make a “clear showing” of each of the following elements: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable injury to the plaintiff if injunctive relief is not granted, (3) a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff, and (4) an advancement of the public interest.

Council, 555 U.S. 7, 129 S.Ct. 365, 374, 376, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) (citation omitted). “The Ninth Circuit recently reaffirmed that within this framework a preliminary injunction also is appropriate when a plaintiff demonstrates that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of the hardships tips sharply in the plaintiffs favor, thereby allowing district courts to preserve the status quo where difficult legal questions require more deliberate investigation,” so long as the other remaining Winter factors are met.

Specifically, the couple alleges that Deputy Krieger repeatedly followed them, both individually and with each other, while they drove on Boone County streets; parked his squad car in front of Ms. Christensen’s place of employment in order to watch her; and sat in his police car outside of businesses that the plaintiffs were visiting in an effort to cause the couple “difficulties with the proprietors of such establishments.”Ms. Christensen and Officer Alty claimed that Deputy Krieger’s actions were performed under color of state law and deprived them of their rights to privacy, freedom of association, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures and “substantive due process rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments.” The complaint further alleges that Officer Alty and Ms. Christensen had filed numerous complaints with Deputy Krieger’s supervisors at the Boone County Sheriffs Department, but that the Department had not taken any action to correct the situation. Finally, the complaint alleges that Deputy Krieger’s conduct constituted the intentional infliction of emotional distress under Illinois law.B. District Court ProceedingsThe district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). First, with respect to the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim, the court concluded that the complaint failed to identify any legitimate expectation of privacy that had been invaded by Deputy Krieger. Second, the court held that the plaintiffs’ “intimate association” claim failed because they had not alleged any actual interference with their relationship. In the court’s view, the plaintiffs’ assertions of feeling annoyed and harassed did not allege an impact on the relationship itself. Finally, the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ intentional infliction of emotional harm claim because they had not pleaded a severe emotional injury and because Deputy Krieger’s behavior, as described in the complaint, was “nowhere near to being extreme or outrageous as that element of the tort is defined by Illinois courts.”","{'Sender': 'Anita Christensen and Robert Alty', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Deputy Sheriff Edward Krieger', 'Recipient Role': 'Law Enforcement Officer', 'About': 'Anita Christensen and Robert Alty', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Personal information, including location and activities', 'Purpose': 'None stated', 'In Reply To': 'None stated', 'Consented By': 'None stated', 'Belief': 'Allegations of harassment and privacy violations by Deputy Sheriff Krieger'}"
,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"{3} In March or April 2006, Mike Sanchez (Mike) visited a local branch of Wells Fargo Bank (the Bank) in order to change the status of his accounts. In light of the recent death of his wife, Mike wanted his two sons, Joe and Gilbert, to be able to assist him with the payment of bills and other financial matters. Mike was advised by the Bank to close his existing accounts and open new ones. To that end, a “Consumer Account Application” was filled out, in which Mike was denominated the “Primary Joint Owner” and his sons were denominated “Secondary Joint Owner[s].” Midway through a paragraph at the bottom of the application is an affirmation that the applicant has “received a copy of the applicable account agreement and privacy brochure and agree[s] to be bound by them.” Mike signed the application, and the joint accounts that are the subject of this appeal were opened.{4} In late October 2006, a writ of garnishment was issued in connection with a civil lawsuit in which Carmen and Isidro Alcantar (the Aleantars) had obtained a judgment against Joe. The writ, which was addressed to the Bank, identified Joe as the judgment debtor and specified that the outstanding balance exceeded $36,000. In its answer, the Bank indicated that it owed Joe $17,474.77. This was the entire amount held in the accounts held jointly by Mike, Joe, and Gilbert. The Bank took immediate possession of all of the funds, such that none of the joint account owners could access them.{5} When Mike received notice of the garnishment, he promptly filed a motion to intervene, asserting that he was in fact the sole owner of all funds in the accounts and contending the garnishment was wrongful. The motion was granted. Mike then filed a permissive complaint in intervention against the Bank, advancing claims of conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and negligence per se. In response, the Bank filed a counterclaim and cross-claim for interpleader, indicating that while it had no claim of its own upon the funds in question, both the Alcantars and Mike had made conflicting claims. Over Mike’s objections, the Bank’s counterclaim and cross-claim for interpleader were granted.{6} Mike filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that his sole ownership of the funds was undisputed. This motion was denied. The Bank then filed its own motion for summary judgment. It contended that its seizure of the funds was in accordance with the terms of the consumer account agreement as well as the law pertaining to garnishment, such that the claims for conversion and negligence were not viable. The Bank further contended there was no basis for the existence of a fiduciary duty. The district court found in the Bank’s favor and granted summary judgment with respect to all of Mike’s claims. Mike was reimbursed by the Bank. This appeal followed.I","{'Sender': 'Mike Sanchez', 'Sender Role': 'Bank account holder', 'Recipient': 'Wells Fargo Bank', 'Recipient Role': 'Financial institution', 'About': ""Mike Sanchez's joint bank account funds"", 'About Role': 'Bank account holder', 'Type': 'Financial information', 'Purpose': 'Account management', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Mike Sanchez', 'Belief': 'That the bank wrongly took possession of his joint account funds due to a garnishment.'}"

According to immigration documents, Gecas, a resident alien, was born in 1922 in Naumiestis, Tau-rage Province, Lithuania. In 1962, he immigrated to the United States from Great Britain. Gecas now resides in Florida. OSI believes that Gecas entered the United States illegally, and it is investigating Gecas for the purpose of deportation. OSI specifically contends that Gecas lied in his immigration application about his activities during World War II and that he assisted Nazi forces occupying Lithuania in committing atrocities during the war and participated in the persecution of persons because of their race, religion, or political opinion. If these allegations are true, then Gecas should not have been allowed to enter the United States.At the deposition, OSI attorneys placed Gecas under oath and asked him to identify documents and to answer questions regarding (1) his background, such as date of birth, residence in Europe during the war, and information on his immigration application; (2) his association with Lithuanian military units and political groups, his relationship to the certain political groups’ publications and his familiarity with specific individuals in the military or the political groups during the war; and (3) his participation in and knowledge of the adverse treatment of Jews during the war. Gecas stated his name and his current and former addresses; he refused to answer all other questions by stating, “I decline to answer on the ground that the answer might tend to incriminate me.” Rl-2-Exh.

This plea was entered pursuant to an agreement between Graves and the government, whereby Graves would plead guilty to the first count of a three count Indictment, in return for the remaining two counts being dismissed at sentencing.

Lovett pleaded not guilty, and then moved to suppress the evidence gathered from a search of the vehicle he was riding in on May 17, 2013.[¶ 3] After hearing, the court found the following facts, which are supported by competent testimony in the suppression record. On May 17, 2013, Agent Shawn Gillen of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency advised Agent Craig Holder of a phone tip that provided information about a white Ford vehicle with Delaware plates leaving Fort Fairfield headed south on U.S. Route One. The informant reported that cocaine was hidden behind the CD player of the vehicle. The informant also reported that the vehicle was operated by a white female who had a black male passenger. At the time Agent Holder received the phone tip, he believed it was from an anonymous source. However, Agent Gillen testified that, at the time of the search, he understood that the tip was not anonymous and that the informant had given reliable information in the past.[If 4] MDEA agents set up a surveillance point outside of Houlton on U.S. Route One, where they observed a white Ford vehicle with a white female operator and a black male passenger. The rear of the vehicle displayed a single Delaware plate. Agents stopped and searched the vehicle. Lovett, who is not challenging the stop of the vehicle, seeks to suppress the evidence found during this search conducted by Agents Holder and Gillen.[¶ 5] The suppression court concluded that MDEA had sufficient probable cause to search the vehicle based on the totality of the circumstances, including the tip and confirmation of details from the tip, as observed by the MDEA agents. Lovett entered a conditional guilty plea for unlawful trafficking of scheduled drugs (Class B), 17-A M.R.S. § 1103(1-A)(A), pursuant to M.R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).

More commonly known as “Filegate,” the Alexander case has been filed as a class action and involves allegations that plaintiffs’ privacy interests were violated when, in 1993 to 1994, the FBI improperly handed over to the White House hundreds of FBI files of former political appointees and government employees under the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Alexander v. FBI, et al., 186 F.R.D. 180, 182 (D.D.C.1999).

Upon being contacted by the IRS, Wells filed for those years but an IRS audit ensued. In June, 1995, Vaught subpoenaed records relating to Wells’s trust account (also referenced as “escrow account”) for the December 31,1991 — January 31,1993 time period. The IRS had been notified of a $64,000 cash deposit Wells had made into a Georgia bank. Wells attests that he had deposited the money on behalf of a client in connection with his client’s 1992 real estate purchase. The subpoena was served upon both Wells and his wife.In response, Wells turned over some records but not those of his trust account, which the IRS believes will provide more information about, inter alia, the $64,000 cash transaction. Appearing before this Court during a March 25, 1996 hearing, Wells insisted that he had nothing to hide, that he had notified his “$64,000 client” of the hearing (no one else appeared besides Wells and the Government), and that he simply wanted to uphold his duty to maintain the attorney-client privilege, though he also objected on the ground that the IRS should not be permitted to conduct a “general fishing expedition” into his trust accounts, violating the privacy interests of his other clients in the process.The privilege Wells asserts arises from his client’s 1992 real estate purchase. Wells provides little in the way of details about the purchase. He claims he “made an inquiry of the purchaser about the source of the funds and the purchaser gave an explanation which was plausible at that time.” A.G. Wells Aff. at 1.

The project included the construction of a fifty-four-room inn. JHR commissioned a feasibility study of the proposed inn, which was intended to determine the viability of including the inn as a component of the larger project. JHR’s manager stated in a meeting with town officials that the study was also developed to evaluate the inn from a business planning perspective and to obtain private financing for the inn.[¶ 3] JHR sought the Town Council’s approval of a tax increment financing (TIF) agreement to help fund the project. To assist in evaluating the need for a TIF, in January 2010 the Town requested a copy of the feasibility study from JHR, which JHR provided. On February 19, 2010, Anastos requested a copy of the study from the Town. The Town considered Anastos’s request and conferred with JHR about it, and JHR asked that the study not be publicly disclosed. The Town Director of Finance and Director of Economic and Community Development reviewed the study and discussed it with the Town Manager. The Town decided not to release the study, and the Town’s attorney sent Anastos a letter notifying him of the Town’s decision. The letter stated that the Town believed that the study was designated confidential by statute, specifically 5 M.R.S. § 13119-A, and was exempt from disclosure under FOAA. The Town also stated that it believed the study was exempt from disclosure pursuant to 1 M.R.S. § 402(3)(B) (2010) as a trade secret or as confidential commercial information that would be exempt from discovery or introduction as evidence at trial pursuant to M.R. Evid. 507 and M.R. Civ. P. 26.[¶4] Anastos filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking a judgment requiring the Town to release the feasibility study. The Town filed a copy of the study under seal for the court’s review. After reviewing the study, the court granted the Town’s motion for summary judgment. The court found that each of the following required elements of section 13119-A(1) was satisfied: (1) the study pertained to a program of assistance; (2) the study was included in a business or marketing plan or was provided or developed to fulfill reporting requirements; (3) JHR requested that the study be designated confidential; and (4) the Town determined that the study gives JHR an opportunity to obtain business or a competitive advantage over a person without access to the study and that disclosing the study would result in significant detriment to JHR. Based on the statutory language and legislative history, the court rejected Anastos’s argument that the Town was required to release a redacted version of the study upon determining that only parts of the study were confidential.

See Second Amended Complaint f113-55. The defendants in this action are her employer and various officials including a direct supervisor and the manager of human resources. See id.The case has had a long four and a half year history of discovery, mediation, and motion practice. Plaintiffs original attorney, Joseph H. Orlando, Esq., was relieved from his duties in this case on January 6, 1996. Plaintiffs second attorney, John F. Gleson, Esq., was relieved from his responsibilities in this matter on April 10, 1996. On March 23, 1998, Plaintiffs third lawyer, Kevin P. Ko-vacs, Esq., filed a motion with this Court to withdraw his appearance pursuant to L.Civ.R. 102.1. That motion was granted by the Court on April 28, 1998. Plaintiff was given thirty days in which to find substitute counsel or she would be considered a pro se litigant. On June 5, 1998, Plaintiffs fourth and current attorney, John E.

Neither his client nor Defendants were privy to the exact information that was contained in the document. Plaintiff, in response to the motion and in anticipation of what the Kovacs Certification contained, submitted a letter and an in camera certification to this Court. Plaintiffs attorney and counsel for Defendants did not receive a copy of Plaintiffs certification. The Court held oral argument on the motion April 27,1998, and, after making certain that Plaintiff knew what her responsibilities would be if she did not find substitute counsel within thirty days, the Court granted Mr. Kovacs’s motion.On June 5, 1998, the Court held a status conference in this matter in which Plaintiffs new attorney participated. At that conference, the Court informed the parties that it was necessary to visit the current issue of whether the Court had any obligation to disclose to Defendants the in camera submission of Mr. Kovacs and the subsequent responsive in camera certification filed by Plaintiff. The Court asked Plaintiffs counsel to submit a short memorandum of law outlining Plaintiffs position on the matter. To avoid any potential prejudice to Plaintiff, the Court instructed counsel that any submission was to address the pending legal issue without reference to the factual allegations contained in the two certifications.

On September 14, 2001, the FBI and DOJ announced an investigation into the September 11, 2001, terrorist highjaekings, which was named PENTBOMB. In November 2001, an unnamed individual contacted the Minneapolis Office of the FBI regarding Elnashar. In April 2002, two FBI agents interviewed Elnashar at his home.Shortly thereafter, Elnashar filed an employment discrimination complaint with-the Saint Paul Human Rights Department (HR Department), against his former employer. As part of the investigation, the HR Department sought the identity of the unnamed individual who had contacted the FBI. Elnashar believed that a former coworker or supervisor had made the contact. Elnashar signed a release, authorizing the HR Department to obtain and examine copies of all documents and records contained by the FBI pertaining to Elnashar. The HR Department requested those documents from the FBI. The FBI responded with a letter stating that there were records that were responsive to the request, but that the records were part of the ongoing PENTBOMB investigation and could not be released. The HR Department subsequently dismissed Elnas-har’s employment discrimination claim. Elnashar requested the name of the reporting individual from the FBI on February 26, 2003, and his request was denied.After the denial, Elnashar brought this action.

The e-mail had been forwarded and was allegedly sent originally by or on behalf of Ethiopia. Kidane’s complaint is silent as to whether the individual who sent Kidane the e-mail was located in the United States but the e-mail’s text suggests that individual was located in London. See Am.

Turning to his left, Officer Lira saw Arburn’s “vehicle weaving, S/B Bascom Ave. and almost hit the curb.” Arbum’s vehicle was “weaving in Lane #2,” and was “traveling at about the speed limit” when it “almost hit the west curb of Bascom Ave.” Officer Lira pulled behind the vehicle as it passed in front of him and the car “immediately turned into a parking lot of a business.” Officer Lira “initiated a vehicle stop for the weaving in the roadway.” >Upon contacting Arburn, Officer Lira observed several objective symptoms of intoxication: bloodshot/watery eyes, the odor of an alcoholic beverage, unsteady gait, slurred speech, and horizontal nystagmus. Arburn “needed to lean on [the] police car at times to keep steady” and was “very slow in [his] responses.” Officer Lira arrested Arburn for driving under the influence. On the way to the police station, Arburn began to fall asleep in the back of the police car. A blood-alcohol test administered one hour later confirmed a blood-alcohol content. of 0.23 percent, well over the legal limit of 0.08 percent. (See § 23152.) As a result of the blood test results, the DMV suspended Arbum’s driver’s license.Arburn requested an administrative hearing pursuant to section 13558 to determine whether the suspension of his license was justified. (§ 13558, subd. (a); see also Lake v. Reed (1997) 16 Cal.4th 448, 456 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 860, 940 P.2d 311] [describing right to hearing upon request and hearing process].) At the hearing, the administrative officer was tasked with determining: (a) whether the officer had reasonable cause to believe that Arburn had been driving a motor vehicle in violation of section 23152; (b) whether Arburn was lawfully arrested; and (c) whether Arburn was driving a motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol content of 0.08 percent or greater. (§§ 13557, subd. (b)(2), 13558, subd. (c)(2).) Arburn challenged only the second statutory requirement—that he was not lawfully arrested—and contended that Officer Lira did not have sufficient cause to stop his vehicle. The hearing officer found all three statutory prerequisites met by a preponderance of the evidence and reinstated the suspension of Arbum’s driving privileges.On September 26, 2005, Arburn petitioned the superior court for review of the administrative findings. (See § 13559 [providing for judicial review of license suspension].) The court issued an alternative writ temporarily staying the suspension to consider Arbum’s petition for writ of mandamus. At the hearing on the petition, the court found there was insufficient evidence to support the findings that the investigatory stop was justified. The court issued a writ of mandate directing the DMV to set aside its order suspending Arbum’s driving privileges.

Upon arrival at the Residence, the officers saw a male fitting Taylor’s description walk to the rear of the home and then return to the front of the home. The officers also observed Davis standing in front of the home with her son and daughter.The officers approached the four individuals standing in front of the Residence. Officer Anderson conducted a pat down of Taylor and found no weapons. Because Taylor was angry and argumentative and both officers thought that he appeared intoxicated, the officers detained him in a squad car.Davis wanted to leave the premises, so an officer accompanied her inside the Residence as she gathered her belongings. Once inside, Davis told Officer Weaver that Taylor had fired shots at Davis and her son. Officer Weaver relayed that information to her partner, alerting the partner that they had a crime scene. Officer Anderson then went to the backyard to look for additional people and the gun.In the backyard, on top of a lawnmower and under a recycling bin, Officer Anderson found a Harrington and Richardson .32 caliber revolver loaded with five live rounds. The officers then arrested Taylor and charged him with two counts of aggravated assault. In the instant action, Taylor has been charged in the indictment as a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).At the evidentiary hearing before Magistrate Judge Vescovo, both Taylor and Davis denied giving the officers permission to search Taylor’s residence or yard.

Now a resident of Greenville, Maine, she was about five or six years old at the time. Defendant, Charles Baker, was Hinkley’s teacher. Baker taught kindergarten through third grade at Shirley Elementary, a two-room sehoolhouse.In her Complaint, Hinkley alleges that between approximately 1982 and 1985, Baker often touched her and other students in a sexually inappropriate manner. Specifically: (1) Baker would hug and squeeze Hinkley while kissing her face and nibbling her ears; (2) Baker would stand behind Hinkley, place his hand inside the front of her shirt, and feel her bare chest; (3) Baker would order Hinkley and other students to rub his back and comb his hair; (4) Baker would take Hinkley to sit on a small bed in the back of the classroom for sick students, and there he would hug her, kiss her ears, and blow in her ears and down her neck; and (5) while sitting on the sick bed, Baker would order Hinkley to stroke his neck and back. In addition, Baker occasionally would take Hinkley sledding. While sledding, Baker would make Hinkley sit between his legs, with her back and buttocks pressed against his groin. When the sled would stop, Baker would roll over on top of Hinkley, and remain laying on top of her for an extended period of time.A decade and a half later, on December 13, 1999, Hinkley filed her Complaint against Baker, alleging violations of her Due Process rights, actionable under section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act (Count I).

On January 27, 2016, the magistrate issued her R & R in which she recommended to the district court that both of Mr. Brenner’s motions be denied, and the case dismissed. The magistrate recommended denying Mr. Brenner’s motion to substitute because both of Mrs. Brenner’s claims against Williams-Sonoma were extinguished upon her death.The magistrate further recommended denying Mr. Brenner’s motion for leave to amend the complaint to add himself as a plaintiff under Rule 15 because such an amendment would be futile - given that Mr. Brenner was not a member of the class as alleged in the complaint, and because his claim under Mass, Gen. Laws ch. 93, § 105(a) did not comply with the relevant statute of limitations, which sets a four year window.Although Mr. Brenner did not file a motion to intervene in the case pursuant to Fed. R.

In both encounters, the KGB representative(s) expressed disapproval of her political activities; in the second encounter, the KGB representatives threatened to imprison her.In March 1995, twenty-year old Serafi-movich left Belarus and entered the United States on a three-month student visa, to expire June 14, 1995.

After their marriage, Remesnitskiy apparently applied (or attempted to apply) on behalf of Serafimovich for legal immigrant status for her. He did not receive a response to that petition.

To facilitate Wasco’s operations, both Seitz and Greg created Yahoo! email accounts.In August 2010, a City employee approached Seitz with copies of emails that she and Greg had exchanged using the email accounts. The emails showed that Greg had used the Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (“LEADS”) to research cars parked in front of Wasco properties. Illinois, however, limits use of LEADS to criminal justice purposes. See Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, § 1240.80(a), (d). A few days later, Elgin’s police chief confronted Greg with the emails and notified him of a coming misconduct investigation regarding his use of LEADS.The City officials had obtained the emails through an anonymous letter sent to Elgin’s corporation counsel. Tamara, a fellow Elgin police officer, and Robert Beeter were allegedly behind that letter. They accessed Greg’s email account, read through emails stored on that account, printed the emails at the heart of this litigation, and conveyed those print-outs to the corporation counsel under cover of anonymity.Greg and Seitz sued Tamara and Beeter, alleging violations of the Federal Wiretap Act (FWA), the Stored Communications Act (SCA), and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, in addition to state law claims. Plaintiffs also sued Elgin under the FWA.B. Procedural BackgroundThe City moved to dismiss the count against it on three grounds. First, it argued that the FWA does not authorize a cause of action against municipalities. Second, the City claimed plaintiffs did not adequately allege a “contemporaneous” interception as required by the FWA. Finally, the City argued that plaintiffs did not allege the City knew the emails had been intercepted as the term is defined in the FWA.Reaching only the first grounds for dismissal, the district court concluded that Abbott v. Village of Winthrop Harbor, 205 F.3d 976 (7th Cir.2000), controlled: because the FWA prohibited “persons” from intercepting communications and did not extend its definition of “person” to municipalities, the FWA authorized no cause of action against municipalities. Abbott, 205 F.3d at 980. The district court granted the motion to dismiss on those grounds without reaching the sufficiency of plaintiffs’ pleadings.","{'Sender': 'Greg Welter and Debra Seitz', 'Sender Role': 'Partners and owners of Wasco Investment Corp.', 'Recipient': 'Unknown', 'Recipient Role': 'Unknown', 'About': 'Cars parked in front of Wasco properties', 'About Role': 'Unknown', 'Type': 'LEADS information', 'Purpose': ""To facilitate Wasco's operations"", 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Unknown', 'Belief': 'Unknown'}"

On November 1, as a part of their regularly assigned duties, the detectives were routinely patrolling train stations, bus stations, hotels and motels looking for vehicles with license plates from states known for drug trafficking. While on patrol through the parking lot of the Red Roof Motel, located near Mitchell International Airport, the detectives noticed a 1993 Nissan with Florida license plates. The detectives ran a check on the license plate and learned that the car was registered to a Mr. Garcia of Miami, Florida. The detectives had their drug detection dog, named ""Zig/Z"" sniff the vehicle, Zig/Z alerted to the rear of the vehicle, indicating the presence of illegal drugs. Leffler entered the motel lobby and asked the motel's front desk clerk to check to see if any of the motel guests were Florida residents. Leffler learned that a Mr. Garcia was registered in room 144. Wilke returned Zig/Z to their vehicle and the detectives proceeded to room 144.They knocked on the door, and Victor Diaz, an occupant of the room, pulled back the curtains from the window. At this point, the detectives showed Diaz their badges and stated ""Police Officers."" Diaz opened the door. The detectives again displayed their badges, stated that they were police officers, and requested permission to come in to speak with the occupants. The detectives both testified that Garcia, who was rising from the bed closest to the door, told the police detectives to ""come in.""Leffler testified that he asked Garcia whether they could search the entire room and his luggage and that Garcia replied, ""Go ahead"" and gestured toward the luggage. Wilke confirms Leffler's testimony on this issue. Garcia, however, claims he only gave the detectives consent to search his luggage. The detectives observed several bags of cocaine, some on the floor next to the dresser area, and some on the sink. Both Garcia and Diaz were arrested and charged. Garcia filed a motion to suppress the evidence, which was denied. Garcia pleaded guilty.

He slept and kept his possessions in Jungert’s motor home, which was parked behind the motel. On December 18, 1993, Leslie McKinney’s corpse was found near the Hillary Motel. She had been bludgeoned and strangled. Hawkins was arrested and charged with her murder.Evidence at his trial indicated that Hawkins’ friend, Monte Olson, had introduced Hawkins to McKinney on the evening preceding her death while the three were at a local bar. Hawkins asked Olson to invite McKinney to the motor home for a party later that evening. Hawkins and Olson left the bar and went to Olson’s room at the Hillary Motel. At some point, Olson decided not to attend the party, but at Hawkins’ request, Olson telephoned McKinney at the bar to find out if she would be coming to the party. Hawkins then left Olson’s room.The next morning, Leslie McKinney’s body was found in a wooded area close to the motel, and the police began an investigation. Some time later that day, Dorothy Jungert discovered in a crawl space under the motel a bloodstained bedspread that she recognized as being from the motor home. Jungert’s boyfriend, Bill Hubbard, and Olson showed Hawkins the bedspread. Hawkins pulled the bedspread from the crawl space and then said he wanted to get rid of it because his fingerprints were on it. Hubbard refused to destroy the bedspread and sent Olson to call the police to report the discovery. A short time later, Jungert gave Hawkins one hundred dollars, and Hawkins packed a suitcase, got a ride to the bus station, and left town.Officers Greene and Pedersen of the Lewiston police department responded to Olson’s call regarding the bedspread. Officer Greene testified that Jungert and Hubbard told him that Hawkins left town because he was afraid he was in violation of the terms of his parole in Oregon, but that they were not sure where he was going when he left. When officer Greene asked to search the motor home, Jungert agreed and signed a consent form. In the motor home, the police discovered Hawkins’ flashlight with a palm print in blood on it.

The NFL Players Contract states in pertinent part: “Group licensing programs are defined as those licensing programs in which a licensee utilizes a total of six (6) or more NFL player images on products that are sold at retail or used as promotional or premium items.” The GLA states in pertinent part: “Group licensing programs are defined as those licensing programs in which a licensee utilizes a total of six (6) or more NFL player images in conjunction with or on products that are sold at retail or used as promotional or premium items.”Plaintiff received a “cease and desist” letter from the NFLPA, which stated that the website violated the aforementioned agreements. Plaintiff then filed this action for Declaratory Judgment, seeking this Court to find that their domain of websites does not violate Defendants’ licensing rights. Defendants counterclaimed, seeking declaratory relief that the websites violate its licensing rights, damages for tortious interference with contracts and injunctive relief.The Court notes that Plaintiff and Defendants have stated that there does not exist any genuine issues of material fact in dispute.

Apparently, Mr. Banks’ initial placement in the SHU stemmed from accusations that he was stalking his prison psychologist, Defendant-Appellee Partyka. Mr. Banks, however, alleges that he was confined in the SHU without being charged or given an incident report. While in the SHU, Mr. Banks claims, the prison staff there shredded requests he made to the staff and mocked poetry he wrote to Par-tyka. In addition, Mr. Banks alleges that a Lt. Moses was in charge of the SHU and that Moses, spurred by racial animus, also put Mr. Banks’ requests in the rubbish.Moreover, Mr. Banks maintains that while in transit from Butner to his current facility in Yazoo City, he requested, under FOIA and the Privacy Act, that Defendant-Appellee Joe Keffer provide him all records relating to his transit order. Mr. Banks asserts that he received no records from Keffer. In addition, Mr. Banks claims that he propounded similar requests to the Defendant-Appellee U.S. Marshal in Oklahoma City.

Two sources in the investigation provided information to OPM under an express promise of confidentiality.In May 1983, Mittleman requested copies of her investigative file from OPM. The file was disclosed with portions deleted to protect the identities of the two confidential sources. The deletions were made pursuant to Exemption (k)(5) of the Privacy Act. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(k)(5) (records may be exempt from disclosure if they consist of “investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment”).In 1986, Mittleman filed suit in district court against OPM and other agencies and individuals, seeking review of OPM’s partial denial of her request for the investigatory file. The district court determined that the Privacy Act claim was barred by the two-year statute of limitations and dismissed the FOIA claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Mittleman v.

Mittleman testified before the Subcommittees about her experience with background investigations. Correspondence between Reps. Edwards and Sikorski and then-Director of OPM Constance Newman concerning Mittleman ensued.In October 1991, pursuant to FOIA, Mit-tleman requested from OPM all correspondence, memoranda, and documents involving her OPM background investigation. Specifically, Mittleman sought all documents relating to Newman’s March 8, 1990 testimony before the Subcommittees which referred to Mittleman, and all documents, memoranda, and files concerning the correspondence dated March 13, 1990, April 23, 1990, July 27, 1990, September 21,1990, April 15,1991, and August 20, 1991, between Reps.

OPM relied on Exemption 7(D) for the redactions, asserting that release of the information would jeopardize the identities of the confidential sources. After completing an administrative appeal, Mittleman filed the instant suit in district court alleging that the information was improperly withheld under FOIA.The district court determined that OPM properly withheld the information under Exemption 7(D) because the government had demonstrated: (1) the personnel background investigation was compiled for law enforcement purposes; (2) the sources provided the information under express assurances of confidentiality; and (3) the withheld information could reasonably be expected to disclose the sources’ identities.

In support of his claim, Stone-El points to instances of interference with alleged privileged mail occurring at two separate institutions. First, Stone-El contends that, while incarcerated at the Joliet Correctional Center, Nancy Wright, mailroom supervisor, intentionally opened and refused to mail letters from the plaintiff (1) to R.E.

Stone-El’s second encounter with improper treatment of his mail allegedly occurred at the Dan-ville Correctional Center.

In an unpublished opinion, the federal district court initially observed that the statute on its face is gender-neutral, applying to “any person” over the age of twenty-five who carnally knows a female under the age of seventeen. Relying on Iowa case law, however, the court construed the term “carnal knowledge” as requiring penetration of a female sex organ by the male sex organ and concluded that the law in question punishes only males. The district court noted that the statute discriminated against males both by punishing only males and by protecting only females. Nonetheless, the court held that the discrimination was substantially related to the achievement of important governmental objectives-namely, protecting young females from unwanted pregnancy and emotional trauma-and so was permissible under the equal protection clause. The district court also rejected the other constitutional challenges made by Navedo and denied him habeas corpus relief.","{'Sender': 'Navedo', 'Sender Role': 'Defendant', 'Recipient': 'Iowa district court', 'Recipient Role': 'Court', 'About': 'Female under the age of seventeen', 'About Role': 'Victim', 'Type': 'Personal information (age, gender)', 'Purpose': 'Legal challenge', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Iowa statute is unconstitutional'}"
,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"On November 4, 2004, Jensen drove to the vicinity of Rieck’s 17-acre property in response to a complaint that someone was discharging a firearm near the city limits of Lehi City. Jensen claims that upon arriving he heard gunshots coming from Rieck’s property. He parked his police car across the road from the entrance to Rieck’s land and called for backup. An unpaved driveway leads from the entrance through a wooded area to Rieck’s home. The metal gate at the entrance was closed. A post to the side of the gate supported a mailbox that was topped with a “No Trespassing” sign. One can easily see the driveway through the gate, but trees on either side of the driveway block the view of the interior of the property, and the driveway turns out of view a short distance from the entrance.While Jensen was awaiting backup, Rieck drove his truck down the driveway to go to the mailbox, a trip of several hundred feet. Rieck stepped out of his vehicle and walked to his mailbox, reaching through the gate to pull down the mailbox lid. Jensen approached him to ask about the shots, but Rieck refused to say whether he had been shooting a gun. Jensen claims that he smelled alcohol coming from Rieck and observed that Rieck had blood-shot eyes. Rieck denied drinking (although in his deposition he admitted that he may have been chewing tobacco to which he had added whiskey). Once Rieck retrieved his mail, he told Jensen that he did not have to talk with him and turned to walk back to his truck. Despite Rieck’s protests that Jensen had no right to enter his property, Jensen opened the gate and attempted to stop Rieck. A struggle ensued, during which Jensen sprayed Rieck with pepper spray, accidentally spraying himself in the process. Rieck broke free and drove his truck back to his home. A SWAT team later arrested Rieck there.Criminal charges were filed against Rieck in Utah state court, but the trial court dismissed the charges on the ground that the entry, detention, and arrest were without justification. See State v. Rieck, 196 P.3d 609, 611 (Utah Ct.App.2008). Although the state appealed the dismissal, it did not contest the illegality of Jensen’s entry on Rieck’s property (it argued only that the dismissal was nonetheless improper), and the Utah Court of Appeals affirmed. See id.Rieck then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Jensen and others, seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of his constitutional rights and under various state-law causes of action. The defendants sought summary judgment on all claims, and Rieck sought partial summary judgment on his claims against Jensen. On June 4, 2010, the district court denied Rieck’s motion and granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment except on the claims against Jensen for illegal entry, illegal detention, and excessive force.","{'Sender': 'Police officer ', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement ', 'Recipient': 'Property owner ', 'Recipient Role': 'Property owner ', 'About': 'Complaint of firearm discharge ', 'About Role': 'N/A ', 'Type': 'Information about firearm discharge ', 'Purpose': 'Investigation ', 'In Reply To': 'N/A ', 'Consented By': 'N/A ', 'Belief': 'Suspect may have been under the influence of alcohol'}"

When police officers arrived on the scene, they observed a bloodied, vandalized vehicle with smashed windows. The owner of the car, Willie Hines, told the officers that two brothers had vandalized his vehicle and threatened him with a gun. Hines told the officers that he could identify the two brothers and offered to take them to the place where Hines believed they would be. The officers placed Hines in the back of their patrol vehicle and followed his directions. The police eventually arrived at what they would learn was one of the brothers’ homes and saw two black males on the porch whom Hines identified as his assailants. When one of the suspects on the porch saw the police car, he ran inside. The police approached the other suspect, who remained on the porch, and who was eventually identified as Andre Ponder, the Defendant-Appellant (“Andre”), and observed that his hand was wrapped in cloth and bleeding. The officers proceeded to place Andre under arrest for felonious assault and vandalism to a vehicle. Simultaneously, the officers requested permission to search the home into which the other brother, Kenya, had fled. Kenya’s girlfriend, a resident of the home, refused to allow the police to enter without a warrant. She asked, however, that she be allowed to remove her children, who were asleep in the home, if police were going to enter the house anyway. The police then proceeded to enter and search the premises for Kenya. During their search, they found two guns in the clothes dryer. Eventually, the police found Kenya hiding in a neighbor’s house.On November 9, 2004, a federal grand jury indicted Andre for being a felon in possession of a firearm.

In 1981, as part of its investigation, the Board issued several subpoenas directing Doe and three local banks to provide financial records pertaining to Doe’s handling of entrusted client funds. Doe refused to comply, directed the banks not to comply, and filed suit in district court to quash the subpoenas.Doe challenged the subpoenas on three grounds, each alleged to be a basis for quashing the subpoenas. He argued, first, that the Court of Appeals, from which the Board as its delegatee must draw any powers it possesses, lacks authority to issue subpoenas; second, that, even if the Board has subpoena power, the subpoenas directed to the banks must be quashed because the Board failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 3401 et seq.; and, third, that the subpoenas should be quashed because the Board violated its own procedures in issuing them. In reply, the Board challenged the district court’s jurisdiction to entertain Doe’s complaint and strenuously contested Doe’s allegations that it lacked or improperly exercised its subpoena power.The district court assumed jurisdiction to hear all three claims. It reasoned that, since there was subject matter jurisdiction over Doe’s sole federal claim under section 1116 of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. § 3416 (1976), the court had authority to entertain the state law claims by virtue of its pendent jurisdiction. The court also rejected the Board’s abstention challenge after noting that Congress specifically committed resolution of Right to Financial Privacy Act claims to the federal courts and that a federal court decision would not unduly interfere with the Board’s investigation.Turning to the merits of Doe’s complaint, the district court held that the Court of Appeals — and through it the Board — had authority under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (1976), to issue subpoenas. The court also ruled that the Right to Financial Privacy Act does not apply to the Court of Appeals so that the Board was not required to comply with its notice provisions. And, finally, the court found that the Board had not violated its own procedures in issuing the contested subpoenas.

The DEA also denied Mays access to information in the files of third parties, citing the same provisions. In all, the DEA processed 44 pages in response to Mays’ request, releasing five pages in their entirety, redacting and releasing 14 pages, and withholding 25 pages.Mays filed this action in district court in order to compel release of the withheld information. The Government introduced into evidence the affidavit of Leila Was-som, a DEA paralegal, justifying the exemptions, along with a so-called Vaughn index, containing an itemized account of the disputed documents and of the exemption(s) and rationale(s) under which the DEA withheld or redacted each item. Mays conceded that the Government may withhold the items for which it invoked Exemptions 2 and 7(F), and both sides moved for summary judgment as to the other items. The district court, believing that Mays challenged only the withhold-ings pursuant to Exemption 7(D), granted summary judgment for the Government. The court determined that some of the information in question is the subject of an express grant of confidentiality the DEA made to an informant, and that the DEA impliedly undertook to hold the remainder confidential in light of the danger faced by a cooperating individual who informs on drug traffickers.Mays now appeals and, both pro se and through an amicus appointed by this court, challenges the Government’s application of Exemptions 7(C) and 7(D). (We make no further distinction between the arguments of the appellant and those of the amicus in this court.) Mays concedes that Exemption 7(C) applies to names of third parties and to other identifying information, but contests both the Government’s decision to withhold certain “investigative details” and its failure to segregate and to produce non-exempt information on pages that also contain exempt information. As for Exemption 7(D), he argues that there is insufficient evidence of an express grant of confidentiality, and that the nature of his crime by itself does not support an implied grant of confidentiality.","{'Sender': 'Mays', 'Sender Role': 'convicted individual', 'Recipient': 'DEA', 'Recipient Role': 'law enforcement agency', 'About': 'Mays, third parties', 'About Role': 'informant, drug trafficker', 'Type': 'DEA records', 'Purpose': 'request for copies of DEA records', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'withheld information is not exempt from disclosure'}"

Investigator Neal’s inquiry drew upon informants, information obtained from other law enforcement officers, surveillance of the residence and individuals connected with the suspected drug operation, and a controlled buy of a suspected illegal substance at the residence.Based upon his findings, Investigator Neal contacted Chief Columbia County Magistrate Huguenin in early 1992 seeking a search warrant for the Wright residence. After first hearing the investigator’s oral presentation, Magistrate Huguenin reviewed the written search warrant application and supporting affidavit, then issued a search warrant for the Wright residence. On February 22, 1992, Investigator Neal and others conducted a three- to four-hour search of the Wright residence during which contraband, including approximately one pound of cocaine and one pound of marijuana, was discovered.Following the February 22, 1992, search, Investigator Neal approached Magistrate Huguenin for a second search warrant to allow re-entry of the Wright residence. Investigator Neal supported that search warrant application by reciting, through oral and affidavit testimony, the circumstances and results of the February 22, 1992, search and by noting Assistant United States Attorney Leon Barfield’s opinion that the first search overlooked certain documentary evidence.

Givens completed a credit application form in the name of Waters Associates, 19 Brighton Way, # 2 North, Clayton, Missouri, listing William McGrane as president and Givens as vice president. Givens obtained some chemicals during his visit on February 1; the supplier subsequently shipped additional chemicals to 19 Brighton Way.Because some of the chemicals that Givens ordered could be used to manufacture controlled drugs, American Scientific notified DEA agent Lloyd W. Patterson of the purchase orders. Patterson obtained copies of the orders and credit application, reviewed the purchase orders with a DEA chemist, and determined that the materials ordered might be utilized in manufacturing methaqualone. Methaqualone is a schedule II controlled substance, so it cannot be produced lawfully by unauthorized manufacturers. Waters Associates did not have manufacturing authority for methaqualone.On February 18, 1983, Patterson went to 19 Brighton Way to inspect the premises and surrounding area. The two-story building contained four apartment units, two on each floor, and a basement. He entered the basement through an unlocked door and discovered four storage lockers, each marked with the number of an apartment in the building. The walls of the lockers were constructed of board slats spaced one to two inches apart. Patterson looked into the locker for apartment 2N (the address of Waters Associates) and observed approximately twelve containers labeled by various chemical companies. At the time of this investigation, both McGrane and Givens resided in apartment 2N.As part of his investigation, Patterson obtained a cardboard container with a transmitting device secreted inside. On February 23, 1983, he obtained a court order allowing him to monitor the signal emitted by the transmitter. Some of the chemicals ordered by Waters Associates were delivered to 19 Brighton Way in this special container; by monitoring the signal Patterson later determined that the container had been moved to 2050 Woodson Road in Overland, Missouri.

On March 16, 1983, Patterson applied for and obtained search warrants for apartment 2N at 19 Brighton Way, the corresponding storage locker, and suite 203 at 2050 Woodson Road. The warrants were executed on March 18, 1983. Givens and McGrane were present in suite 203 at the time of the search and were placed under arrest; agents seized chemicals and documents from the suite, including methaqualone and the formula for manufacturing methaqualone.

Murphy”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) in the state courts of Florida. In that proceeding, Rit-ten alleges that T. Murphy, a lessor in the residence where he and J.R. resided, entered J.R.’s bedroom and invaded her right to privacy. (Am.Compl. ¶ 8.) It is further alleged that J. Murphy knew or should have known of the tendency of T. Murphy to wrongfully enter J.R.’s bedroom and invade her right to the private occupancy of her bedroom. (Am.Compl. ¶ 9.) River Country was the owner of the property where T. and J. Murphy resided with J.R. and allegedly failed to ensure J.R.’s right to privacy of her bedroom. (Am.Compl. ¶¶ 10-11.) At the time relevant to the underlying suit, Plaintiffs were insured under a policy of insurance issued by Charter Oak to River Country. Charter Oak notified its insureds that it would not defend any and all of its insureds and there is no coverage for the allegations in the underlying complaint. (Am.Compl.13-15.)Plaintiffs, the defendants in the underlying tort proceeding, initiated the present action against Defendant The Charter Oak Fire Insurance Company (“Charter Oak”) and Ritten individually and as the natural parent and legal guardian of J.R. In the Amended Complaint filed in this case (DE 1-2), Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to Chapter 86, Florida Statutes to determine whether the Charter Oak policy provides coverage, in whole or in part, and a duty to defend Plaintiffs in the underlying tort proceeding brought by Ritten. The Amended Complaint states that Defendant Ritten is named in the suit as an interested party pursuant to Florida Statute § 86.091. According to the Amended Complaint, the Murphys and Ritten are Florida residents, River Country is a Florida limited liability company and Charter Oak is a foreign corporation. (Am.Compl. ¶¶ 3-7.)In its Notice of Removal, Charter Oak stated that there is diversity of citizenship between the parties and that Ritten was fraudulently joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction. Plaintiffs’ motion for remand contends there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties because Ritten is an interested party and Florida Statute § 86.091 requires that he is joined as a party to the lawsuit. Charter Oak responds that Ritten should either be dismissed as fraudulently joined or realigned as a plaintiff in this action.","{'Sender': 'Charter Oak', 'Sender Role': 'Insurance Company', 'Recipient': 'Plaintiffs', 'Recipient Role': 'Defendants in the underlying tort proceeding', 'About': 'J.R.', 'About Role': 'Minor child of Defendant John T.

This time, he alleges in his handwritten pro se complaint (technically his second amended complaint) that defendants’ policy of having female guards regularly view his bathroom and shower use from four to five feet away violates his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and causes him severe emotional harm due to his own history of abuse. He also alleges that this policy conflicts with defendants’ policy that prohibits female guards from strip searching male prisoners in non-emergency situations.The district court sua sponte dismissed the complaint because “[t]he policy to which Plaintiff objects is precisely the type of cross-gender supervision that has long been held constitutional in the Ninth Circuit.” Because the district court dismissed the complaint under section 1915A, we do not have defendants’ side of the story, such as any counterbalancing security or personnel management issues to consider.II.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"As stated in several opinions by this court, the underlying allegations in this case arise from what has become popularly known as “Filegate.” According to their complaint, plaintiffs allege that their privacy interests were violated when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) improperly handed over to the White House hundreds of FBI files of former political appointees and government employees under the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that Bernard Nussbaum, Craig Livingstone, and Anthony Marceca committed the common-law tort of invasion of privacy by willfully and intentionally obtaining plaintiffs’ FBI files for improper political purposes. Based upon these allegations, plaintiffs seek to certify their lawsuit as a class action on behalf of all “former U.S. Government employees, whose confidential FBI files were improperly obtained from the FBI by the White House.” Plaintiffs’ Complaint H15.On February 18,1997, the Attorney General of the United States certified that plaintiffs’ common law invasion of privacy claims arose from conduct within the scope of Nussbaum’s, Livingstone’s, and Marceca’s employment. For this reason, the United States filed a notice under the Westfall Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2679, to substitute itself for these named defendants. See Notice of Substitution, filed February 18, 1997. Based upon this substitution, the United States moved to dismiss the claims made against it (i.e., those originally made against Nussbaum, Livingstone, and Marceca) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as provided in the Federal Tort Claims Act. Plaintiffs opposed the United States’ notice of substitution and motion to dismiss.The court later held a hearing on all pending motions, including the United States’ notice of substitution and plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On June 12, 1997, the court deferred ruling on these two matters pending the opportunity for plaintiffs to take some limited discovery. In later ruling upon the parties’ Local Rule 206 report, the court held that plaintiffs would have six months to complete all discovery relating to the scope-of-employment and class certification issues. Order of August 12, 1997. That schedule, however, proved to be unworkable. Accordingly, on April 21, 1999, the court extended the deadline for the initial phase of discovery to June 12, 1999 and granted plaintiffs leave to take a maximum of only five more depositions on the issues of class certification and scope of employment. Because plaintiffs have now taken all five additional depositions allowed, they now seek leave of court to depose Leslie Gail Kennedy.","{'Sender': 'FBI', 'Sender Role': 'Government agency', 'Recipient': 'White House', 'Recipient Role': 'Government agency', 'About': 'Former U.S. Government employees', 'About Role': 'Employees', 'Type': 'Confidential FBI files', 'Purpose': 'None specified', 'In Reply To': 'None specified', 'Consented By': 'None specified', 'Belief': 'None specified'}"

The Marshals Service took booking photographs (also known as “mug shots”) of Giro on May 27, 2009 after taking him into custody. (Bordley Aff. ¶ 7, Ex. A. to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J.) On July 13, 2009, the Marshals Service denied Plaintiffs request for copies of these photographs pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C) (hereinafter, “Exemption 7(C)”) on the basis that they were gathered for law enforcement purposes and releasing them would constitute an unwarranted invasion of Giro’s personal privacy.

Plaintiff insists that summary judgment is inappropriate because the Marshals Service does not follow its policy of non-disclosure in some cases (because it released booking photographs of Bernard Madoff and Joe Nacchio), Giro does not have a privacy interest in the booking photographs, and disclosing the booking photographs will help the public determine if the Marshals Service gives preferential treatment to high-profile prisoners like Madoff and Nacchio.","{'Sender': 'Theodore Karantsalis ', 'Sender Role': 'Freelance Reporter ', 'Recipient': 'United States Marshals Service ', 'Recipient Role': 'Law Enforcement Agency ', 'About': 'Luis Giro ', 'About Role': 'Former President of Giro Investments Group, Inc.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In his petition, Davis alleges that he is challenging “the superior court’s denial of due process” to him during the Brady proceedings. His theory is that the prosecutor failed to provide the court with sufficient information about Officer Walker to make a fair ruling and that the superior court “abused its discretion” by conducting a review of Walker’s personnel files for Brady material “when petitioner did not have an opportunity to be heard on the issue and the court made its decision based solely on the prosecution’s presentation of the pertinent circumstances.”To support this claim, Davis purports to provide a more accurate or complete summary of Officer Walker’s testimony which states:“15. On direct examination, Officer Walker testified that he and a partner had responded to the area of Howard and 7th Streets in response to a dispatch call and established a crime scene perimeter. Officer Walker collected and booked into evidence the screwdriver, the cuff links, and the foreign money. Walker testified that he had not entered the residential unit before the suspect was removed by other officers.“16. Defense counsel’s cross-examination of Officer Walker was centered upon the issue of where the coins, cuff links and screwdriver had come from and what had happened to the missing cash. Officer Walker said he was handed the three items by another officer, but was vague and/or evasive about the circumstances. For example, while Walker had no problems answering the questions asked on direct, on cross examination he claimed no recollection approximately 20 times.“17. Officer Walker could not recall if he was the one who had strip searched Mr. Davis to look for the cash, though the fact that he had done so was stated in another officer’s report. While admitting he had glanced at parts of the police report, Officer Walker claimed no memory of the conditions at the crime scene or who was with him at any particular time.”Davis contends that he was precluded from sharing these pertinent facts about Officer Walker with the superior court and was thereby deprived of his constitutional right to due process. To remedy the alleged constitutional violation, Davis seeks a peremptory writ of mandate compelling that court to hold a new Brady hearing for which Davis will have notice, appointed counsel, and “a full opportunity to submit evidence and be heard on the issue of the potential materiality of the sealed documents.”","{'Sender': 'Davis ', 'Sender Role': 'Defendant', 'Recipient': 'Superior Court ', 'Recipient Role': 'Court ', 'About': 'Officer Walker ', 'About Role': 'Police Officer ', 'Type': 'Testimony ', 'Purpose': ""Challenging the court's denial of due process "", 'In Reply To': 'None ', 'Consented By': 'None ', 'Belief': 'Davis was precluded from sharing pertinent facts about Officer Walker with the superior court and was thereby deprived of his constitutional right to due process.'}"

A deputy for the division of unemployment insurance denied claimant's request for benefits based on his employment with Destination Vail Hotel. It is not disputed, however, that claimant received unemployment benefits based on his work for the Telluride employer.{4 Claimant appealed, and following an evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer affirmed the deputy's decision. The hearing officer found that claimant voluntarily quit his employment with Destination Vail Hotel to be closer to his girlfriend. The hearing officer rejected claimant's arguments that he was entitled to benefits from Destination Vail Hotel because he was not at fault for losing his subsequent job. Consequently, the hearing officer concluded that claimant was at fault for his separation from Destination Vail Hotel and disqualified him from receiving benefits from this employer under section 8-78-108(5)(e)(IV).5 Claimant appealed the hearing officer's decision to the Panel, which affirmed upon review. The Panel concluded that claimant's separation from the subsequent employer was not relevant to the issue of his separation from Destination Vail Hotel. The Panel noted that each separation from a base period employer must be individually adjudicated in order to determine a claimant's entitlement to benefits attributable to that employment.

The police searched one residence and found no one inside. They then searched the second residence, which had an entrance door ajar, and found Lewis. No one else was there. They arrested Lewis, and a search incident to the arrest revealed a knife and a firearm magazine in his possession. They also searched the home where he was found and discovered three firearms. The home belonged to Marisa Martin, who later described Lewis as a “[cjlose friend” who had been renting the other residence from her for less than a month.

Prior to the plea, Lewis moved to suppress “all statements [he] made ... as well as all gun and ammunition evidence collected.” (Id. at 25.)At the suppression hearing, Martin testified to the following facts: Lewis did not have a key to her home; Lewis did not have permission to be in her home at the time of arrest; she did not own any guns; she did not leave Lewis in her home when she departed that day; and the only way he could have been in her home is if he had broken in. Additionally, Officer Lind-quist testified that the two residences were not connected to each other and that no one else was found inside Martin’s home when Lewis was arrested.

The vehicle contained four occupants; two in the front (Greg Kelly, who was the driver, and Kelly’s son, who was the front passenger), and two in the rear bench seat (the Appellant was sitting behind the driver and Kenny Cunningham was sitting behind the front passenger). Kelly was unable to produce proof of insurance or registration, and the vehicle came back as being registered to a used car lot.Officer Burgess testified that he recognized Cunningham because his partner had previously arrested him for drug-related activity, and he thought Cunningham appeared impaired. He requested consent to search the car, but Kelly refused. Officer Burgess then contacted Officer Shannon Taylor to bring a specially trained narcotics-detection dog to the scene. They arrived fifteen minutes later, while Officer Burgess was in the process of issuing Kelly’s citation. Based on Kelly’s lack of insurance and registration, Officer Burgess decided to tow the vehicle.Officer Taylor had the occupants get out of the vehicle. He separated and patted each of them down for weapons, finding none. Officer Taylor then conducted a dog sniff of the exterior of the vehicle. The dog “alerted” on all four doors, which indicated that drugs were present in the vehicle. He then had the dog sniff the car’s interior, and it alerted on the front passenger seat headrest, where a crack-cocaine pipe was recovered. Cunningham, who had been sitting behind the pipe-containing headrest, was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia.The dog also alerted on the back driver’s-side seat (where the Appellant had been sitting), but no other drugs were recovered from the vehicle. Officer Taylor patted down the Appellant a second time, and when he indicated he had found something, the Appellant admitted he was in possession of cocaine. He shook his legs and two baggies containing crack-cocaine fell from his groin area and out of his pants legs to the ground, and he was arrested. Approximately 90 minutes elapsed from the initial stop of the vehicle until the Appellant’s arrest.At the police station, the Appellant waived his Miranda rights and gave a statement to police in which he said he was in town from Dayton, Ohio, to sell cocaine. He was indicted for first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance.The Appellant filed a motion to suppress the drug evidence seized from his person.

Voces requested copies of all 1-247 forms that the Sheriff received from ICE since November 2014. The custodian, Captain Catherine Trimboli, responded to Voces, but indicated that she was unable to immediately provide the requested forms. She explained that she needed to speak with ICE.¶ 6. Voces filed a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to compel the Sheriff to produce the 1-247 forms. Prior to ruling on the mandamus, as a compromise, the circuit court ordered the Sheriff to produce redacted copies of all 1-247 forms. Accordingly, the Sheriff produced twelve 1-247 forms, but redacted the following information: (1) subject ID; (2) event number; (3) file number; (4) nationality; and (5) a series of boxes pertaining to immigration status. On April 7, 2015, the Sheriff provided forms with the detainee's nationality no longer redacted.¶ 7. On June 3, 2015, the circuit court granted Voces' writ of mandamus and ordered the Sheriff to produce all 1-247 forms, unredacted. Conducting a balancing test, the court weighed Voces' strong interest in examining 1-247 forms against the Sheriffs interest in protecting the information contained within the forms. The circuit court concluded that the balancing test weighed in favor of disclosure. The court ordered the Sheriff to produce unredacted versions of the 1-247 forms to Voces within forty-eight hours, but stayed the order until June 12, 2015.¶ 8. The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court. The court concluded that 1-247 forms are not exempt from disclosure under Wisconsin public records law. The court concluded that ""(1) no exception to disclosure under Wisconsin's open records law applies; and (2) the Sheriff failed to meet his burden of showing that the public interest in non-disclosure outweighs disclosure, given Wisconsin's very strong legislative intent and public policy favoring disclosure.""¶ 9. First, the court of appeals rejected the Sheriffs argument that 1-247 forms are exempt from disclosure under Wis. Stat. § 19.36 because a federal regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 236.6, prevented disclosure of immigration-related information in the possession of state or local entities. The court reasoned that the regulation applied to only those individuals currently in custody of the federal government. Because the individuals at issue in the present case were not currently in federal custody, the court of appeals reasoned, the federal regulation did not prevent the release of 1-247 forms. Next, the court concluded that the public interest balancing test weighed in favor of disclosure.¶ 10.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Thornbrough was charged with dishonesty for lying on his 1997 District employment application by claiming he lived in Roseville, and by omitting the fact that there was a disciplinary matter pending against his state contractor’s license. The hearing officer found Thornbrough had not misled the District about his license, because his “superior(s) knew of the matter” and his job did not require a contractor’s license. The hearing officer found “no doubt” that Thornbrough misrepresented his home address on his application, and Thornbrough admitted he had done so. The hearing officer found he did so as part of a “scheme” with a former District employee, “to increase his opportunity to be hired. This act of dishonesty, however, was known to several of Mr. Thombrough’s supervisors over the years and never was any adverse action . . . taken. The passage of time renders this incident too remote to form the basis for independent discipline.” Nonetheless, the hearing officer found this act of dishonesty was relevant in assessing Thombrough’s credibility, particularly since Thornbrough showed no remorse and his demeanor at the hearing “suggested he considered the matter trivial, if not amusing.” The hearing officer also found this act of dishonesty was relevant to the appropriate level of discipline.The final charging document did not allege the “Paco” and “Pepe” remarks as misconduct, but alleged Thornbrough retaliated against David and others for participating in the earlier sexual harassment complaint against Thornbrough, and alleged he engaged in harassment based on gender and ethnicity. But under the rubric of “discourtesy,” one of the hearing officer’s findings was that “Thornbrough engaged in discourtesy of an extreme nature when he used clearly derisive ethnic slurs such as ‘Paco’ and ‘Pepe’ to refer to [David], who is of Hispanic origin.” The trial court impliedly agreed with Thornbrough that this finding was erroneous in the way it was framed because there was no evidence Thornbrough continued to use those slurs after the prior disciplinary matter was settled, but the trial court found, in its independent judgment of the evidence, that these remarks were relevant to show Thornbrough’s bias towards and later retaliation against the Zinzuns.","{'Sender': 'Thornbrough', 'Sender Role': 'District employee', 'Recipient': 'Hearing Officer, Supervisors, Trial Court', 'Recipient Role': 'Legal officials', 'About': 'Thornbrough', 'About Role': 'District employee', 'Type': 'Personal information, disciplinary matter, ethnic slurs', 'Purpose': 'Legal proceedings', 'In Reply To': 'Sexual harassment complaint', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': ""Thornbrough's dishonesty and harassment""}"

Plaintiff alleges that between March 1993 and September 1995, Endee engaged in acts of sexual harassment by making unwelcome verbal remarks and offensive sexual advances toward her. For instance, it is alleged that over a period of time, Endee slapped the plaintiff on the buttocks; grabbed her by the arms, hands, and thighs; and touched her on the head and neck.It is alleged that in 1994 the plaintiff complained to her immediate supervisor, Joanne Murone (“Murone”). It is further alleged that Murone failed to report her complaints to other officials or take necessary steps to end Endee’s offensive and obnoxious conduct. In November of 1994, the plaintiff complained to the Undersheriff, Cliff Howard (“Howard”). She alleges that Howard merely repeated her complaints to Endee and accepted his claim that she was lying, without reporting back to her. In addition, it is alleged that the Undersheriff told Murone that there was nothing more he could do and that he was washing his hands of the situation. Consequently, plaintiff claims that the defendants took no steps to ameliorate the hostile work environment.The defendants deny plaintiffs allegations. In particular, Endee alleges that the plaintiff made unwarranted and untruthful complaints to Murone and Howard. Moreover, Endee denies that any improper conduct occurred and that plaintiff was not subjected to a hostile work environment. Finally, Endee maintains that any conduct toward the plaintiff was not intended to unreasonably interfere with her work performance or alter the conditions of her employment, but rather was intended to better the plaintiffs work performance and the efficiency and smooth operation of the Sheriffs Department. Finally, the defendants maintain that upon learning of the plaintiffs claims of alleged sexual harassment, they took prompt and effective remedial action to ameliorate the situation.On September 15,1995, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the defendants pursuant to General Municipal Law § 50-e, giving notice of an action for damages for battery, the intentional infliction of emotional distress, and the violation of state and federal civil rights.

Petitioner faces charges for importing cocaine, for conspiracy to distribute, and for operating a continuing criminal enterprise, inter alia. Indicted with Falcon were Salvador Magluta, Orlando Benigno Lorenzo, Juan Adriano Barroso, Luis Florentino Escobedo, Terry Dominick Blanco, Antonio Garrudo, Louis Mendez, Victor Manuel Alvarez and Gustavo Falcon. The government seeks forfeiture of thirteen different parcels of real property in Florida, any personal property contained therein, and in excess of 2 billion dollars which it claims represents the proceeds of the illegal narcotics trafficking alleged in the indictment.Petitioner alleges that shortly after his arrest on October 15, 1991, he was placed in administrative detention at MCC-Miami, and remained there until November of 1991. On August 25, 1992, after Hurricane Andrew heavily damaged MCC-Miami, petitioner was transferred to FCI-Talladega. Between November 1991 and June 1993, petitioner was held in administrative segregation at either MCC-Miami or FCI-Talladega. On June 29, 1993, petitioner was transferred to USP-Atlanta and placed in the maximum security unit. From August 2 to 6, 1993, he was transferred to the maximum security unit at MCC-Miami for evidentiary hearings. He was then sent back to USP-Atlanta until September 21,1993, when he was returned to MCC-Miami for hearings preceding the original trial date.Just before trial was to commence, the district judge granted a motion to suppress on September 30, 1993, prompting an appeal by the government on October 1. On October 7, 1993, petitioner was transported to USP-Marion. As of the date of this Order, the appeal of the suppression ruling is still pending, and the trial date has been rescheduled for January 3, 1995.The record reveals that a number of potential witnesses in this case have been murdered, including Bernardo Gonzalez; former co-defendant Luis Escobedo; and Juan Acosta, an attorney who allegedly laundered money for Falcon and Magluta. The respondents further allege that other potential witnesses have been shot, but have survived their wounds, including Juan Barroso, an alleged drug smuggler who was scheduled to testily against petitioner.The Falcon drug cartel is reputed to have vast financial resources available, with estimated gross assets of 55 billion dollars.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,". In early 2013, the department announced that it would begin subjecting prison visitors to search by drug-detecting dogs. The plaintiffs commenced this action to prevent the department from implementing the new policy. The plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that the policy was not authorized by the department's existing regulations, as well as a preliminary injunction to enjoin the department from implementing the policy without its being promulgated pursuant to the APA. A judge in the Superior Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the wording of the regulation governing visits by members of the general public was broad enough to allow for canine searches.The policy was thereafter implemented. The dogs performing the searches are not aggressive and remain leashed at all times. They ""alert"" to the presence of a banned substance by sitting; they do not snarl, lunge, or bite. There are alternative procedures for those visitors who are allergic to, or afraid of, dogs.A second Superior Court judge granted summary judgment for the commissioner, entering a judgment declaring that the commissioner had the authority to establish the policy without having to comply with the procedural requirements of the APA because the policy is ""sufficiently similar to the searches specifically enumerated in the regulatory language.""

Believing one of his employees might have been involved, Newell placed a recording device on the telephone extension so that he could monitor all calls made to and from the store phone. The extension to which the recorder was attached was located in the Spears’ residence, which was adjacent to the liquor store. The recorder operated intermittently from June 27 untü August 13,1990. Many of the recorded conversations involved employee Sibbie Deal (now Sibbie Lucas) and Calvin Lucas, who upon discovering what the Spears had done, filed suit.

The citizen described the suspect’s vehicle as a maroon Lincoln Continental, license plate number LLN 135, which had stopped at the corner of 36th and Walnut.The police dispatcher contacted two patrol officers and told them to investigate a complaint about an armed individual driving a vehicle of the above description at the above location. When the officers arrived at the intersection, they found Cox standing next to a red Ford LTD bearing the above license number. His vehicle had a flat tire. The driver’s side front door hung partly ajar.The first officer on the scene frisked Cox, but found no weapons. The second officer to arrive went directly to the vehicle, opened the front door and searched under the driver’s seat. He found a gun, handcuffs and police scanner. This prompted further inquiry, during which Cox claimed to be an undercover DEA agent. He produced government identification that appeared authentic.As Cox showed signs of intoxication, the officers ticketed him for drunk driving. They then released him, and returned his weapon, believing Cox to be a federal officer.In August 1989, Cox and an unidentified black male entered the home of Manuel Perez, holding themselves out as FBI agents. Cox demanded a kilogram of cocaine. When no kilogram was forthcoming, Cox searched the premises while the accomplice guarded the door. As a result of the search, Cox “confiscated” some $6,900 in cash, three ounces of cocaine and a revolver. Cox directed the operation and appeared to be in charge.Cox returned to Perez’s residence three more times. On each occasion, Cox presented himself as a federal agent.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In 2006 Karen Thompson, one of Armstrong’s coworkers at the Office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), filed an anonymous complaint against Armstrong. The complaint alleged Armstrong had accessed an investigative database without authorization and had disclosed confidential information he obtained there.Thompson’s complaint triggered an internal investigation, at the opening of which Armstrong was relieved of his badge and law enforcement credentials, denied the use of his government vehicle and computer, and escorted out of the building and driven home. The next day he was reassigned to the Technical and Firearms Support Division.The investigators ultimately concluded Armstrong had accessed not just the one database, which he admitted doing, but also other databases, without authorization or an official purpose. Because the TIG-TA did not immediately close the investigation and impose a sanction, Armstrong was able to apply for a job at other agencies while still a TIGTA employee.In 2007 Armstrong applied for and accepted a position within the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Agriculture; he was to start that September. In mid-August one of Armstrong’s coworkers at the TIGTA circulated an email message about a going-away party for him, which alerted the rest of the office to his impending departure.Shortly before Armstrong was to start his new job, Thompson sent six USDA employees anonymous letters, signed “A Very Concerned Person,” with information about the TIGTA’s ongoing investigation, of Armstrong. In three of those letters, she said hiring Armstrong was “a grave error.” Within days the USDA indefinitely postponed Armstrong’s start date. He never worked there.Armstrong later brought this- suit against the Secretary of the Treasury, Armstrong’s former supervisor, and several unnamed Treasury employees. He alleged various common law torts and six violations of the Privacy Act, one for each letter Thompson had sent to the USDA. When he filed his complaint, however, Armstrong did not know who had written the letters.Shortly before trial Thompson admitted she had written the letters as well as the anonymous complaint that had caused the TIGTA to investigate Armstrong. 610 F.Supp.2d at 69. At trial she denied, however, getting the information in the letters from any of the TIGTA supervisors involved in the investigation or from records of the investigation; instead she insisted she had based the letters upon independent sources—the rumor mill, her original complaint, and her own observations, assumptions, and speculation.After trial the district court dismissed the claim against Armstrong’s supervisor and entered judgment for the defendants on all other claims.

United States v. Ritchie , 15 F.3d 592, 598 (6th Cir. 1994).Defendants do not specify here, but appear to generally make a facial attack on the sufficiency of Plaintiff's pleadings.

Plaintiffs are special education teachers who are employed by defendant, Freeport School District 145. Each of the plaintiffs are currently assigned to “EXCEL” and “Life Skills” classrooms. Recent allegations of abuse taking place within these classrooms led the School District to seek to install audio/visual recording equipment in these classrooms. The audio/visual equipment was to be installed in an open and obvious manner in these classrooms, “where the most vulnerable children, both physically and emotionally challenged, were assigned.” Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings at 3.Plaintiffs filed suit in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of Illinois seeking to enjoin District 145 from carrying out its proposed policy of operating audio recording equipment in its “EXCEL” and “Life Skills” classrooms. Plaintiffs have not raised any challenge to the proposed video recording of the subject classrooms, having focused their entire challenge against the audio component of the School District’s proposed audio/visual monitoring policy. Plaintiffs contend that the proposed audio recording is improper for two reasons. First, plaintiffs claim that any audio recording of the classrooms will violate their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Second, plaintiffs claim that the proposed audio recordings will violate the Illinois Eavesdropping Act, 720 ILCS 5/14 — 2(a)(1). Based on these objections to the proposed audio recording, plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction to prevent audio recording from taking place in the subject classrooms.Because the federal court has original jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim, defendant removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

After selecting the boat they wished to purchase, Inland Marines’s financial manager assisted them in applying for a loan of $10,000.

Even though Plaintiffs claim they were never late with monthly payments, the credit reports obtained by Inland Marine when Plaintiffs attempted to purchase a boat reflected a number of delinquent payments based on information furnished by Defendants. As a result of the credit reports, both of the potential lenders refused Plaintiffs’ loan application for the boat. When Plaintiffs were able to obtain a loan for the boat, they paid a higher interest rate as a result of the credit report. Plaintiffs contacted the Defendants to remedy the erroneously reported information, but Defendants offered no assistance or response. Plaintiffs then contacted Equifax to dispute the information.

Nevertheless, the district court granted summary judgment to both DEA and Customs on the ground that the Privacy Act does qualify as a withholding statute. In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied upon the statutory language and legislative history of the Privacy Act. Further, the district' court’s analysis was supported by decisions from the fifth and seventh circuits, and by dictum in an earlier opinion of this court. Nevertheless, we cannot uphold the decision.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"A. Factual BackgroundOn March 6, 1995, the plaintiff submitted a FOIA request to the FBI Miami Field Office (“MFO”) and FBI Headquarters (“FBIHQ”). See Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. at 1. On April 28, 1995, the MFO notified the plaintiff that the FBIHQ would handle his entire request. See id. at 1-2. Nearly four years later, on April 7, 1999, the FBI provided the plaintiff with a list of the files located in response to his requests. See id. at 2. The list indicated that the government had located more than 69,000 pages of responsive documents. See id. at 4; Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. C (letter to the plaintiff from John M. Kelso, Chief, Freedom of Information — Privacy Acts (“FOI-PA”) Section Office of Public and Congressional Affairs, dated April 7, 1999) (describing the vast number of documents found in response to the plaintiffs request and offering to accelerate the plaintiffs request if he agreed to limit its scope).After negotiations, the plaintiff agreed to reduce the scope of his request. On February 29, 2000, FBIHQ forwarded the plaintiff 663 pages of materials (for the most part concerning the plaintiffs attempt to kill a federal officer, racketeering, obstructing justice, and defrauding a financial institution charges). See Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. at 2, 4, Ex. D. Nonetheless, the FBI did not forward the plaintiff all the information that he had expected. Instead, it withheld certain information (mostly by means of excision, but the FBI denied in full 78 pages) pursuant to various FOIA exemptions. See Ex. D at 13. The FBI also informed the plaintiff that some documents he had requested originated with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), and that those agencies would respond to the plaintiff directly. See Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. at 3. Finally, the FBI denied in full 13 pages of information concerning certain audiotapes. See id.B. Procedural HistoryThe plaintiff filed his initial complaint with this court on November 3, 1995. On March 31, 1998, this court granted the motions for summary judgment filed by federal defendants Department of Justice, Criminal Division; Executive Office of the U.S. Attorneys; Customs Service; and Drug Enforcement Agency. See Mem. Op. dated March 31, 1998. On June 22, 2001, after numerous extensions of time, status reports, and motions for interlocutory appeal, the only remaining defendant, the FBI, filed the motion for summary judgment currently under consideration.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"The arrest in this case arose from an-investigation by the Lea County Drug Task Force and the FBI of a drug-trafficking organization operating in Hobbs, New Mexico. One of the subjects of their investigation was Rolando Cantu, the defendant’s brother and also his next-door neighbor. At the request of the Task Force, the local utility company installed a video camera on a utility pole approximately 70 yards from the brothers’ adjacent residences. This was the closest utility pole to the propei’ties. The pole was on the side of a paved alley providing access to a parking lot and commercial buildings. The camera allowed agents to observe the front of the brothers’ properties, as well as a common, unpaved area between Rolando Cantu’s house and the defendant’s trailer. The camera did not record sound, and it did not allow the agents to see inside either property. It provided a continuous live feed to a television screen at the Task Force office. Agents at the Task Force office could adjust the camera, zoom it in and out, and take still photographs. Although they are uncertain precisely when it was removed, the Task Force was using the camera at another address a few months after the surveillance of the Can-tus’s properties.During the course of this surveillance, the Task Force’s commander saw someone on the video feed walking in the common area between the two residences, carrying what looked like an assault rifle. The commander captured several still photographs from the feed. It is apparent from these photographs that a car or pedestrian coming down the street would have seen the man carrying the weapon. See Attachments to Aple. Br. The Task Force agents knew from New Mexico Probation and Parole that Ruben Cantu, the defendant, lived in the residence next to Rolando Cantu. The agents compared a photograph of Ruben Cantu with the still photographs from the video camera, which allowed them to identify the man carrying the assault rifle as Ruben Cantu. After reviewing his criminal history and seeing a prior felony conviction, the Task Force obtained a search warrant for Ruben Cantu’s property. The agents found an AR-15-assault rifle and over 100 rounds of ammunition.","{'Sender': 'Lea County Drug Task Force and FBI', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement agencies', 'Recipient': 'Task Force agents at the office', 'Recipient Role': 'Law enforcement agents', 'About': 'Ruben Cantu', 'About Role': 'Defendant', 'Type': 'Personal identifying information', 'Purpose': 'Investigation of drug trafficking and possession of illegal weapons', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'The surveillance operation was necessary and justified for law enforcement purposes'}"

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"{3} Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants as an appeal from an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s finding of no probable cause regarding various employment-related causes of action, including discrimination and retaliation. Defendants were provided counsel through the State’s Risk Management Division. Included in Plaintiff’s allegations of fact was the accusation that, upon filing his complaint against Defendants, they had retaliated against him by asserting irregularities with regard to gross receipts returns filed by Schneider’s private law practice. In his deposition, Plaintiff expanded on this episode, stating that Defendants ’ ill intent was demonstrated by the fact that Schneider had filed non-compliant gross receipts returns for some years prior to his complaint without action by the Department. Defendants’ timing of the notice from Plaintiffs supervisor thus demonstrated their intent to retaliate against him and his family.{4} Two weeks after the deposition, Defendants added Schneider to their witness list. Immediately thereafter, they filed a motion seeking leave to subpoena Schneider and the Department seeking “[a]ll CRS-1 [f]orms, [registration [c]ertificates, [assessments, [delinquency [njotices, correspondence^] and all other documents related to the New Mexico gross receipts taxes reported and/or paid . . . for the time period from January 1, 2000 through and including June 30, 2008.""{5} Defendants requested a hearing to precede the issuance of the subpoenas. Schneider did not attend the hearing requested by Defendants’ counsel on its motion to issue the subpoenas. However, Defendants demonstrated their understanding that discovery of tax information was a potential problem early on. Defense counsel informed the court during the hearing on their motion to issue the subpoenas that “it is the policy of the . . . Department statewide not to honor those subpoenas.” He further stated “that’s because of the statutory confidentiality of tax records. I have not, I or my clients, do not have access to those records without violating the law.” Defense counsel further stated that absent a “really necessary” court order, release of the records would constitute “a gross breach of the statute [and] I believe a misdemeanor.”{6} To provide Schneider an opportunity to respond to the subpoenas, the court issued the subpoena to her and waited for her to respond before allowing the subpoenas to issue. Schneider responded with a motion to quash the subpoenas and argued that confidentiality provisions contained in the Act, NMS A 1978, § 7-1-4.2 (2003), and the evidentiary privilege embodied in Rule 11-502, prohibited disclosure of the information without her permission. She also requested a protective order. Schneider furthermore argued that, pursuant to NMSA 1978, Section 9-11-11 (1977), Defendants’ attorney could not represent them and, therefore, could not subpoena her tax records on their behalf. The district court denied Schneider’s motion and ordered the subpoenas andprotective orders to be issued to the Department and to her. The order was issued, and Schneider timely sought appellate review of the order, both by way of direct appeal and writ of error. We granted the petition for writ of error in February 2010.","{'Sender': 'Defendants ', 'Sender Role': 'Legal Counsel ', 'Recipient': 'Court ', 'Recipient Role': 'Legal Authority ', 'About': 'Schneider ', 'About Role': 'Private Citizen ', 'Type': 'Tax Records ', 'Purpose': 'Subpoena in Employment Discrimination Lawsuit ', 'In Reply To': 'None ', 'Consented By': 'Schneider ', 'Belief': ""Defendants seek to retaliate against plaintiff by subpoenaing tax records of Schneider's private law practice without proper legal authority.""}"

On this particular morning, she noticed something different. Wilcox’s bedroom television had been left on and when she moved close to the table in Wilcox’s bedroom where she applied make-up and lotion, her image came into view on the television screen. Believing that she was being videotaped, she gathered her belongings and changed in another room. After she changed, she returned to Wilcox’s bedroom, located a hidden video camera, and removed the tape from the camera.[¶ 3] The young woman told Officer Beaulieu not only about the morning incident, but also of specific “child pornography” she had seen on Wilcox’s computer, of Wilcox’s use and possession of marijuana, and where he kept his marijuana in the home. She and Officer Beaulieu viewed the videotape and saw her in the nude and dressing.[¶ 4] Based on this information, Beaulieu sought a search warrant.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"On March 6, 1984, Berry was arrested on drug charges. The next day, a D.C. Superior Court Commissioner (“Commissioner”) released Berry on his own recognizance on the condition that he submit to an immediate urinalysis drug test. If Berry tested positive, he was then supposed to participate in the drug testing and treatment program administered by the District’s Pretrial Services Agency (“PSA”). Apparently, Berry did not submit to a drug test before he was released, and he did not report to the PSA for further tests or treatment.On June 20, 1984, Berry was again arrested on drug charges. The next day, a Commissioner released him into third-party custody with the same conditions that followed his March arrest. This time Berry did submit to a urinalysis drug test, which was positive for cocaine and opiates. The PSA then instructed Berry to report for weekly drug tests. When Berry failed to report for his scheduled tests, the PSA notified the D.C. Superior Court that he had violated his conditions of release. After a show cause hearing was held on August 14 to determine whether Berry’s bail should be revoked, Berry was released with the same conditions that followed his March and June arrests. He did not report for testing, however, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest on August 24. At a hearing several weeks later, the D.C. Superior Court quashed the warrant and set a $2000 surety bond; Berry was unable to post bond and was jailed.On August 29, 1984, Berry filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Besides making several claims relating to his arrests, Berry claimed that the District’s drug testing and treatment program violated his rights under the Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments. In a memorandum order dated June 14, 1985, the District Court granted the District’s motion for summary judgment with respect to this last claim. Berry v.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"The appellant, who is using the pseudonym John Doe, is a member of the bar of the District of Columbia and is currently the subject of an investigation by the Board on Professional Responsibility. In 1981, as part of its investigation, the Board issued several subpoenas directing Doe and three local banks to provide financial records pertaining to Doe’s handling of entrusted client funds. Doe refused to comply, directed the banks not to comply, and filed suit in district court to quash the subpoenas.Doe challenged the subpoenas on three grounds, each alleged to be a basis for quashing the subpoenas. He argued, first, that the Court of Appeals, from which the Board as its delegatee must draw any powers it possesses, lacks authority to issue subpoenas; second, that, even if the Board has subpoena power, the subpoenas directed to the banks must be quashed because the Board failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 3401 et seq.; and, third, that the subpoenas should be quashed because the Board violated its own procedures in issuing them. In reply, the Board challenged the district court’s jurisdiction to entertain Doe’s complaint and strenuously contested Doe’s allegations that it lacked or improperly exercised its subpoena power.The district court assumed jurisdiction to hear all three claims. It reasoned that, since there was subject matter jurisdiction over Doe’s sole federal claim under section 1116 of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, 12 U.S.C. § 3416 (1976), the court had authority to entertain the state law claims by virtue of its pendent jurisdiction. The court also rejected the Board’s abstention challenge after noting that Congress specifically committed resolution of Right to Financial Privacy Act claims to the federal courts and that a federal court decision would not unduly interfere with the Board’s investigation.Turning to the merits of Doe’s complaint, the district court held that the Court of Appeals—and through it the Board—had authority under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (1976), to issue subpoenas. The court also ruled that the Right to Financial Privacy Act does not apply to the Court of Appeals so that the Board was not required to comply with its notice provisions. And, finally, the court found that the Board had not violated its own procedures in issuing the contested subpoenas.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In October, 1991, a rare confluence of meteorological events led to a “massively powerful” weather system off the New England coast. The fishing vessel known as the Andrea Gail was caught in this storm and lost at sea. All six of the crewmembers on board the Andrea Gail, including Billy Tyne and Dale Murphy, Sr., were presumed to have been killed. Newspaper and television reports extensively chronicled the storm and its impact. Based on these reports, and personal interviews with meteorologists, local fishermen, and family members, Sebastian Jun-ger penned a book, entitled The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea, recounting the storm and the last voyage of the Andrea Gail and its crew. The book was published in 1997.That same year, Warner Bros, purchased from Junger and his publisher the rights to produce a motion picture based on the book. Warner Bros, released the film, entitled The Perfect Storm, for public consumption in 2000. The Picture depicted the lives and deaths of Billy Tyne and Dale Murphy, Sr., who were main characters in the film. It also included brief portrayals of each individual that is a party to this appeal. Nonetheless, Warner Bros, neither sought permission from the individuals depicted in the picture nor compensated them in any manner.Unlike the book, the Picture presented a concededly dramatized account of both the storm and the crew of the Andrea Gail. For example, the main protagonist in the Picture, Billy Tyne, was portrayed as a down-and-out swordboat captain who was obsessed with the next big catch. In one scene, the Picture relates an admittedly fabricated depiction of Tyne berating his crew for wanting to return to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Warner Bros, took additional liberties with the land-based interpersonal relationships between the crewmembers and their families. .While the Picture did not hold itself out as factually accurate, it did indicate at the beginning of the film that “THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY.” A disclaimer inserted during the closing credits elaborated on this point with the following statement: “This film is based on actual historical events contained in ‘The Perfect Storm’ by Sebastian Junger. Dialogue and certain events and characters in the film were created for the purpose of fictionalization.”On August 24, 2000, the Tyne and Murphy children, along with Tigue and Kosko, filed suit against Warner Bros, seeking recompense under Florida’s commercial misappropriation law and for common law false light invasion of privacy. In a May 9, 2002 Order, the district court granted Warner Bros.’s motion for summary judgment on all counts. The court found that (A) the term “commercial purpose” in Fla. Stat. § 540.08 was not meant to extend the statute’s reach to the use of an individual's name or likeness in an expressive medium, and (B) the Picture did not fall into the narrow “relational right of privacy” exception to the general rule that false light claims are non-descendible.","{'Sender': 'Warner Bros.', 'Sender Role': 'Film Production Company ', 'Recipient': 'Public ', 'Recipient Role': 'N/A ', 'About': 'Billy Tyne, Dale Murphy Sr., and crewmembers of the Andrea Gail ', 'About Role': 'Individuals whose likeness was used in the film ', 'Type': 'Likeness ', 'Purpose': 'Commercial use in a film production ', 'In Reply To': 'N/A ', 'Consented By': 'Individuals whose likeness was used in the film did not provide consent ', 'Belief': 'N/A'}"

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In 1975, when plaintiff Brooke Shields was 10 years old, she and her mother, plaintiff Teri Shields, reached an arrangement with Gross, a commercial photographer, for these photographs to be taken. Brooke Shields was paid $450 for the photo sessions by Playboy Press, and her mother signed a release giving Gross unlimited rights to use or publish the photographs. Some of the photos, those in controversy, were posed naked.These photographs have been displayed or published in a variety of ways. Two in particular, which plaintiff characterizes as the most revealing, appeared in 1976 in a Playboy Press publication entitled Sugar & Spice and, in larger-than-life-size enlargements, in the windows of a fashionable boutique on Fifth Avenue in New York. More recently, some of the photographs have appeared in at least five publications, some of them decidedly disreputable.For the last two years plaintiff has litigated in the New York state courts to prevent the distribution of these photographs. Her suit was based on two legal theories: first, she contended that the consent given at the modelling session was either invalid or to be narrowly construed. This contention was rejected by the trial court, and the ruling was affirmed on appeal. Second, she contended that she is entitled under the common law of New York to disaffirm her mother’s consent. This too was rejected at trial; the Appellate Division reversed and enjoined Gross from using the photographs “for purposes of advertising or trade.” Shields v. Gross, 88 A.D.2d 846, 451 N.Y.S.2d 419 (1st Dep’t 1982). The Court of Appeals, however, vacated the Appellate Division’s injunction, 58 N.Y.2d 338, 461 N.Y.S.2d 254, 448 N.E.2d 108 (1983), ruling against Shields. Plaintiff asserted no federal claims in the New York courts.Throughout the pendency of that action, the New York courts granted plaintiff interim injunctions forbidding Gross from displaying the photos. The last of these expired when the Court of Appeals denied her motion for reargument late on Friday, April 29, 1983.On Monday morning, May 2, 1983, the first business day after the expiration of the state injunction, plaintiff commenced this action by filing a complaint which asserts that the distribution of the photographs would infringe plaintiff’s federal constitutional right of privacy.Simultaneously with the filing of the complaint, and without giving notice to the defendants, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order. Defendants somehow learned of the application and telephoned the clerk requesting that no action be taken without their being heard. They appeared in court and agreed voluntarily to refrain from distributing or displaying the photos for the brief time needed to complete the submissions on the preliminary injunction motion. All parties have now completed their submissions, and the preliminary injunction motion is ripe for decision.","{'Sender': 'Brooke Shields', 'Sender Role': 'Plaintiff', 'Recipient': 'Gross (photographer)', 'Recipient Role': 'Defendant', 'About': 'Brooke Shields', 'About Role': 'Plaintiff', 'Type': 'Nude photographs', 'Purpose': 'None', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Brooke Shields and her mother', 'Belief': 'Brooke Shields believes that the distribution of the photographs would infringe her federal constitutional right of privacy.'}"

Charvat alleges that during the third call, he asked Defendants’ live agent to place his name and residential telephone number on Defendants’ do-not-call list.On March 18, 2009, Charvat filed suit against NMP, LLC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging violations of the TCPA, 47 U.S.C. § 227, and the OCSPA, Ohio Rev.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In 1982 the Drug Enforcement Administration investigated and found baseless certain allegations that then-U.S. Senator Dan Quayle had used cocaine. During the 1992 presidential campaign, renewed speculation in the media about Quayle’s alleged cocaine use led AUSA John Thar, of the Southern District of Indiana, to disclose the findings of the 1982 investigation to the Indianapolis Star with the following explanation:I’m disclosing what I have, with approval, simply because so much has been made out of nothing____ It’s all been so misconstrued____ I’m making an honest disclosure of what was found, hoping to put an end to it.James A. Gillaspy, Feds Reveal Details of Quayle Drug Probe, Indianapolis Star, Nov. 13, 1991, at 1. The Star described Thar’s disclosure as “a rare departure from the Department of Justice policy of withholding comment about any investigation.” The Office of Professional Responsibility, which handles allegations of improper conduct by DOJ officials, investigated the disclosure. In response to an inquiry from the press Thar acknowledged that he was disciplined as a result of the OPR investigation at a level of severity somewhere between “you’ve done something wrong” and “you’re fired.” Aaron M. Freiwald, Quayle Accuser Presses Conspiracy Claims, Legal Times, March 30, 1992 at 1, 20.In 1994 Kimberlin sought disclosure pursuant to the FOIA of “all papers, documents and things pertaining to the OPR investigation” of Thar. Initially the OPR gave a standard Glomar response, refusing either to confirm or to deny that such an investigation had taken place. Cf. Phillippi v. CIA, 546 F.2d 1009, 1011 (D.C.Cir.1976) (CIA refused to confirm or deny existence of information regarding research vessel Glomar Explorer). When Kimberlin brought suit in district court to compel disclosure and confronted the OPR with evidence that Thar had acknowledged publicly that the OPR had investigated his disclosure to the Star, the OPR withdrew its Glomar response and released two press clippings from its file on the investigation. The OPR withheld the balance of the file on the ground that it comes within Exemption 7(C) to the FOIA, which provides that an agency may withhold “records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes” to the extent that the production thereof “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).The district court reviewed in camera some or all of the OPR file, together with a memorandum from the Government detailing its reasons for withholding the contents of the file. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held that “the Government has properly invoked Exemption 7(C) and may continue to withhold such information fr’om public disclosure.” Kimberlin v.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"This case arises out of an action pending between private parties in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In that action, appellant seeks damages from several parties for alleged insider trading in the stock of a corporation later acquired by appellant. Appellant alleges that its cost of acquisition was artificially inflated as a result of the illegal insider trading.In connection with its investigations of insider trading on Wall Street, the SEC had looked into suspicious activity by several defendants in the underlying action. As a result, the Commission accumulated a large quantity of documents. Appellant has received some 40,000 pages of them delivered pursuant to request under the Freedom of Information Act.Appellant seeks more through a subpoena obtained from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The subpoena directs the Commission to designate a witness to testify and produce documents related to alleged insider trading in the stock of the corporation acquired by appellant. Pursuant to the subpoena, the Commission did provide some documents but declared its intention to seek a court ruling that, based upon claims of privilege, it need not produce a small quantity of the documents.At this point, counsel for appellant and the Commission met and agreed to cancel the oral deposition and proceed on written questions. The SEC agreed to answer a limited number of questions focused on the purchase of stock in the acquired corporation by certain defendants in the underlying action. The SEC reserved the right to object to any of appellant’s questions.Appellant thereafter propounded questions to be answered by the SEC at a deposition on July 13, 1987. Six questions called for production of all evidence of securities laws violations by several defendants in the underlying action. Appendix [App.] 12-13. Appellant later propounded two related, redirect questions. App. 24-26. On July 10, 1987, the Commission notified appellant that it would object to all eight questions as calling for protected attorney work-product and to three (direct questions 2, 3, and 7) on the basis of law enforcement investigatory privilege. The SEC appeared at the deposition, made its objections, and refused to answer.On August 12, 1987, appellant, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, moved to compel the Commission’s response. On September 10, 1987, appellee Department of Justice (Department) moved for leave to intervene in opposition. App. 53-66. The Department argued that disclosure of the information would interfere with on-going criminal investigations. The Department also moved for permission to file an ex parte affidavit under seal containing “sensitive and confidential information.” Supplemental Appendix [Supp.App.] 53.On September 11, 1987, the District Court granted the Department’s motions to intervene and to file an ex parte affidavit, and denied appellant’s motion to compel.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"In 1993, Jack Lavin was working in the New York office of Bankers Trust (BT). One of Mr. Lavin’s responsibilities in the New York office was to supervise traders. These traders bought and sold various financial instruments, including derivatives, for BT clients. Due to the highly speculative nature of derivatives and other financial instruments, BT maintained a policy of tape recording all telephone calls that took place on certain telephones in the New York office. These telephones were located on a trading floor within the New York office and were used primarily by the traders in their dealings with clients. All the telephones on the trading floor were marked with a plaque to remind users that conversations on those telephones were tape recorded. It was common knowledge among the members of the division where Mr. Lavin worked that BT maintained a tape recording policy.In January 1994, Mr. Lavin was transferred to become the head of BT’s Chicago office. Prior to Mr. Lavin’s arrival in Chicago, that office did not have a tape recording policy because the employees in that office did not trade in derivatives. When Mr. Lavin learned of this fact, he engaged in discussions with other BT employees concerning the implementation of a tape recording policy in the Chicago office. Mr. Iannuz-zi, who at the time was in charge of BT’s telecommunications, testified that Mr. Lavin himself, wanted a tape recording system in place because Mr. Lavin, among others, was to begin trading in derivatives from the Chicago office.After learning of alleged improprieties in BT’s marketing of derivatives, the SEC and the Federal Reserve Bank initiated collateral investigations. As part of these investigations, the SEC and the Federal Reserve Bank have requested and received thousands of tape recordings of conversations involving BT employees.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Wolfe, a Missouri used-car dealership, is insured under two policies issued by Universal. One policy provides up to $500,000 for indemnity from and defense against suits for damages arising from Wolfe’s “wrongful repossession” of an automobile, and this is linked under a separate policy to $25 million in umbrella coverage (we will refer to these linked coverage provisions together as the “umbrella coverage”). One of the policies also separately provides up to $25,000 for costs in defending against suits arising from the sale of an automobile (the “customer complaint defense” provision), subject to both a $2,500 and a $100,000 deductible. Under the policy, Wolfe may be entitled to either the umbrella coverage or coverage under the customer complaint defense provision, but not both.Wolfe sold a vehicle to Tyrrell and Liane Jackson (the Jacksons), retaining a security interest for loaning them the purchase money. Wolfe later repossessed and sold the vehicle due to missed payments. After retaking possession but before the sale, Wolfe sent a notice informing the Jacksons they could request an accounting for a $25 charge, and after the sale it sent a notice charging the Jacksons attorney’s and legal fees. Wolfe sued for the deficiency balance, and the Jacksons counterclaimed on behalf of themselves and similarly situated consumers, alleging Wolfe’s pre- and post-sale notices violated Missouri’s Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) and the Missouri Motor Vehicle Time Sales Act (MVTSA). Specifically, the Jacksons alleged that the presale notice violated a requirement under the U.C.C. that upon request they be provided with one free accounting and that the notice inform them of that entitlement. Mo.Rev.Stat. §§ 400.9-210(f), -613(1)(D), -614(1)(A). They alleged that the postsale notice violated the U.C.C. by charging them fees and expenses that were not actually incurred in connection with the sale of the vehicle, id. §§ 400.9-615(a)(l), -616(c)(4), and that it violated the MVTSA because the attorney’s fees were in excess of fifteen percent of the deficiency balance and because the charged expenses were unreasonable. Id. §§ 365.100(2), (4). The Jack-sons did not dispute that they were in default and that Wolfe had the right to repossess the vehicle.Wolfe tendered the Jacksons’ counterclaims to Universal for defense and indemnity under the umbrella coverage. Universal refused on the ground that the allegedly deficient notices were not wrongful repossessions as that term is meant in the policy, stating Wolfe was only entitled to coverage under the customer complaint defense provision. Preferring the benefits available under the umbrella coverage, Wolfe sued Universal for a declaration of its rights under the policy, as well as for breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay. Universal counterclaimed for declaratory judgment in its favor. The district court sided with Universal on cross-motions for partial summary judgment and summary judgment. It reasoned the umbrella coverage only applied to repossession that is itself wrongful, not to wrongful debt-collection practices that may involve but are unrelated to repossession. Wolfe now appeals the district court’s grant of summary judgment to Universal.","{'Sender': 'Wolfe', 'Sender Role': 'Used-car dealership', 'Recipient': 'Universal', 'Recipient Role': 'Insurer', 'About': 'Tyrrell and Liane Jackson', 'About Role': 'Customers', 'Type': ""Repossession notices, attorney's and legal fees"", 'Purpose': 'Defense against counterclaim', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Wolfe is entitled to umbrella coverage according to the policy'}"

The registration tag was obscured by dust and dirt, so Officer Murbarger could not read it. To determine whether the defendant’s registration was valid, Officer Murbarger checked the defendant’s license plate number through a computer. While doing so, he followed the defendant’s car. He estimated that he followed the defendant for approximately seven blocks. During this time, the defendant committed no traffic violations. The computer report indicated that defendant’s registration had expired in November 1999 and that the license plate was registered to a car other than the car the defendant was driving. As a result of this information, Officer Murbarger stopped the defendant.Officer Murbarger told the defendant the reason for the stop and asked him for his driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance. The defendant told the officer that he did have a valid registration for the car and gave him the requested documentation. Officer Murbarger took the documents back to his patrol car, where he looked at them and checked the defendant’s driver’s license number through the computer. Although the officer was not certain in which order he had looked at the documents, he unequivocally testified that he had requested all three at the same time. Upon inspecting the registration card, Officer Murbarger determined that it was valid for the car that the defendant was driving. At some point, he inspected the sticker on the defendant’s plate and determined that it was valid as well, although he does not recall exactly when this occurred. As a result of checking the defendant’s driver’s license through the computer, Officer Murbarger discovered that it had been revoked. He issued the defendant a citation for that offense.On February 9, 2001, the State charged the defendant by information with driving while license revoked (625 ILCS 5/6 — 303(d) (West 2000)).

At approximately 9:47 p.m., after observing a Chevrolet Monte Carlo with a defective rear license plate light pass by, Smith activated his emergency lights and pulled over the vehicle just north of Sanger, Texas. Alexander was the driver and Jason Lee Walker (“Walker”) was the sole passenger in the automobile. The entire traffic stop was recorded on a video camera installed in Smith’s patrol car.Smith approached the vehicle from the passenger side and entered into a brief discussion with the occupants. He explained the reason for the traffic stop and then requested a driver’s license from both individuals. While engaged in conversation, Smith observed that Alexander and Walker avoided any kind of eye contact and exhibited extreme nervousness. He also testified that Alexander’s hand was shaking as he relinquished his license and that Walker’s carotid artery was pulsating. Further, he described Walker’s breathing as “unusually heavy.”Noticing that Alexander presented an Arkansas driver’s license and the vehicle bore Arkansas license plates, Smith was puzzled by the occupants’ circuitous itinerary to their declared destination of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. As Smith testified, traveling from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Oklahoma City via Dallas was an “indirect route” and that “there was a much shorter way.” Additionally, Smith noticed a number of air fresheners affixed throughout the interior of the vehicle, unopened packages of air fresheners on the floorboard, and a single key in the ignition. These factors, according to Smith, led him to believe that criminal activity was afoot.Smith subsequently returned to his patrol car to perform driver’s license and warrant checks. The dispatcher relayed the results of the checks — finding no outstanding warrants — at 9:53 p.m. Rather than immediately issuing a warrant or citation for the defective license plate light, Smith returned to the driver’s side of the automobile to resume questioning the occupants due to his suspicion of nefarious activity. Within two minutes, the occupants communicated different accounts of their journey in separate interviews. Alexander stated that they had left Arkansas several days prior to the stop while Walker maintained that they had left that morning.Based on what he perceived to be indicators of potential criminal activity, Smith requested consent to search the vehicle approximately twenty minutes after the stop was initiated. Alexander gave his consent. Upon the arrival of a second officer, a quick search of the interior of the vehicle revealed two false compartments secreted behind decorative panels containing what Smith believed to be “narcotics in bundles.” Smith terminated the consent search, arrested Alexander and Walker, and advised them of their Miranda rights. After the vehicle was towed to a DPS office, an inventory search uncovered ten kilograms of cocaine.","{'Sender': 'Trooper Richard John Smith', 'Sender Role': 'Law Enforcement Officer', 'Recipient': 'Alexander (driver) and Jason Lee Walker (passenger)', 'Recipient Role': 'Private Citizens', 'About': 'Alexander and Jason Lee Walker', 'About Role': 'Private Citizens', 'Type': 'Traffic Stop and Vehicle Search', 'Purpose': 'Investigation of Potential Criminal Activity', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Alexander', 'Belief': 'Trooper Smith believed criminal activity was afoot based on indicators observed during the traffic stop and interaction with the vehicle occupants.'}"

While Schilling made sure that Hansen's children would not be present at the sentencing hearing, he did not inform other family members that he was going to play the tape or otherwise give them an opportunity to leave the courtroom before he played it. Schilling turned off the tape before it had finished playing because he recognized that it was having a dramatic effect on the family members.¶ 4. In July 2001, five of Hansen's survivors (collectively ""complainants"") filed a complaint against Schilling with the Crime Victims Rights Board (Board). After determining that there was probable cause to believe that Schilling had violated the complainants' crime victims' rights, the Board held an evidentiary hearing on May 30 and 31, 2002.¶ 5.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Riverside Sheriffs’ Association (Sheriffs’ Association) and the county provided for an administrative appeal. The parties chose arbitrator Jan Stiglitz as the hearing officer.Drinkwater intended to urge a disparate treatment defense, claiming that others had committed similar misconduct but were not fired. Accordingly, she sought discovery of redacted records “from personnel investigations of any Department employees who have been disciplined for similar acts of misconduct.” (See Pegues v. Civil Service Com. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 95, 105-106 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 705]; Talmo v. Civil Service Com. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 210, 229-231 [282 Cal.Rptr. 240].) Limiting her request to events during the previous five years, she sought incident summaries, the rank of the officer, and the discipline imposed. The department objected, arguing in part that Drinkwater could not satisfy the requirements for a Pitchess motion under Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045, and could not establish the good cause required for discovery. Stiglitz denied the motion without prejudice, ruling the department need not search its records for similar disciplinary cases. Instead, Drinkwater was obligated to identify particular officers whose records she believed were relevant to her claim.Drinkwater renewed her motion, supported by counsel’s declaration that 11 named officers had allegedly committed similar misconduct but received little or no discipline. Stiglitz ordered production of the 11 officers’ records for in camera review.The department sought a writ of administrative mandate in superior court. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5.) It argued initially that Drinkwater failed to establish good cause for discovery because counsel’s declaration was speculative and Pitchess discovery was only available for officers involved in the underlying incident at issue. The department then filed a supplemental brief citing the recent case of Brown v. Valverde (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1531 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 429] (Brown). Brown held that a driver facing a license suspension for driving under the influence could not seek Pitchess discovery in a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) administrative proceeding. (See discussion, post) Relying upon Brown, the department argued only judicial officers could grant Pitchess motions, depriving Stiglitz of authority to rule. The superior court agreed and granted mandate, ordering Stiglitz to reverse his prior order.The Sheriffs’ Association sought to intervene, moving to set aside the mandate order and to secure a new hearing. Intervention was granted.

Both times the trash bags contained indicia of residency and tested positive for cannabis. Officers also discovered that Watson had been previously convicted of obstruction of justice and arrested (although not charged) for aggravated battery. Two days after the second positive test, officers presented this information to a state judge and obtained a warrant to search the residence.Police executed the warrant the next day, but not without issue. The supervising officer who had a copy of the warrant had to leave the scene before Watson arrived home with her father to meet with the officers. So when Watson asked to see the warrant, one of the remaining officers had to run back to the police station to get another copy. Alas, the copy of the warrant eventually shown to Watson apparently was not the correct one. In any event, officers executed the warrant and, in addition to drugs, found a semi-automatic handgun. Leonard admitted he owned the gun. Because he had been previously convicted of a felony, he was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).Leonard moved to suppress the gun and to require the government to disclose the identity of the tipster. The district court denied both motions. On the suppression motion, the court held that (1) the mistake in warrant presentation did not affect the validity of the warrant; and (2) even though the informant was probably unreliable, the two positive cannabis tests were enough, standing alone, to support the warrant. The court then refused to require disclosure of the tipster's identity because his or her identity was irrelevant to Leonard's case. Having lost his motions, Leonard conditionally pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. He timely appealed.","{'Sender': 'Confidential source', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Rock Island, Illinois, police', 'Recipient Role': 'Law enforcement', 'About': 'Courtney Watson', 'About Role': 'Suspect', 'Type': 'Confidential tip', 'Purpose': 'Reporting illegal drug activity', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Confidential source believes that Courtney Watson is selling illegal drugs from her home.'}"

This court has dealt with other issues arising from this case in Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 90 F.3d 553 (D.C.Cir.1996) (petition for rehearing in bane pending), Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274 (D.C.Cir.1993), and Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F.2d 282 (D.C.Cir.1991). The district court has issued numerous orders and opinions.Armstrong’s original FOIA request was for all documents from the Reagan Administration found in the Professional Office System (PROFS) maintained by the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and the National Security Council (NSC). PROFS is an office automation system that contains information such as e-mail correspondence, memoranda, and calendars. This initial request was for an enormous number of documents.The number of documents requested has been substantially reduced over the course of this litigation. In February 1992, appellant narrowed his request to a subset of the PROFS materials. In September of that year the district court entered a stipulation and order that the government process and release PROFS materials that had already been printed out in hard copy. In January 1994, the district court entered another order, further narrowing the scope of appellant’s request and ordering the government to comply. The scope of the request has been further limited by an agreement between the parties.In response to these requests, the government has released a substantial number of documents, many of which have had portions redacted. Appellant has, over the years, challenged these redactions and the government has responded to some of these challenges by releasing the requested documents in full. The remaining redacted documents are described in the Vaughn index prepared for this litigation.The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. Appellant requested that the district court review 17 documents in camera, urged the court to compel the disclosure of the names of lower-level FBI agents who attended White House meetings, and challenged the government’s failure to disclose a one-page Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) document. The district court ruled that it would review four, documents in camera, but upheld the government’s refusal to disclose the names of the FBI agents and the OSTP document. After reviewing the four documents in camera, along with an in camera affidavit supplied by the government, the district court held that all of the redactions were justified. The issue regarding the OSTP document has been mooted by the government’s disclosure of the document.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"A. Factual BackgroundIn this case, the plaintiffs are current and former non-liturgieal Christian chaplains in the Department of the Navy (“the Navy”). The defendants are the Secretary of the Navy, other Navy officials and the Navy. According to the plaintiffs, in the late 1960s and 1970s, America’s religious demographics began a substantial shift away from liturgical Protestant denominations toward the non-liturgieal Christian churches, which the plaintiffs represent. Am. Compl. at 29. Until the mid to late 1980s, the Navy used a rough proportional-representation plan to determine how many chaplains it would hire from various religious denominations. Id. at 29. Under this system, the Navy allegedly allocated chaplains among the various faith groups based on objective criteria, such as the relative percentage represented by a religion in the total American population. Id.The plaintiffs allege that starting in the late 1980s and continuing to the present, however, the Navy switched to a subjective policy, referred to as the “thirds policy,” under which the Navy allegedly reserves one-third of the Navy’s slots in the Chaplain Corps for liturgical Christians, one-third for Catholics, and one-third for members of every other religion. Id. at 29-30. Non-liturgical Christians are included in this last, catchall category. Id. at 30.B. Procedural HistoryThe plaintiffs filed their class-action complaint on March 17, 2000. Subsequently, on September 5, 2000, the plaintiffs amended their complaint as of right. On September 22, 2000, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.

The court concluded, inter alia, that the statute of limitations did not bar the plaintiffs’ claims for purposes of the motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had fraudulently concealed the facts necessary to their causes of action. Id. at 54-55.Subsequently, on February 7, 2002, the court held a status hearing at which it issued an order setting a schedule for further submissions, including the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Order dated Feb. 7, 2002. On March 26, 2002, pursuant to the court’s order, the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification.

Defendants, both DEP itself and its employees Henry Bar-net, Gregory Gibson, Pinky Hall, Roy Dickey, and Amy Schmidt have been sued by Plaintiff for multiple causes of action culminating from various incidents involving workplace occurrences that Plaintiff found objectionable. Plaintiff primarily complained about two activities. First, Plaintiff complained of favoritism given to a new DEP employee during the hiring process. Second, Plaintiff complained of the Bureau Chief Elwood Stephens’ use of emergency dispatch lines to report a false crime in order to incriminate another employee (hereinafter referred to as “Stephens’ call”).Plaintiff consulted with Investigator Percy Griffin at the DEP’s Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) about filing an anonymous complaint regarding Stephens’ call but ultimately decided not to file a complaint at that time. Plaintiff also complained to David Tripp with the Florida Highway Patrol about Stephens’ call. Subsequently, Plaintiff was called into a meeting by superior officers and told not to complain any more about either of the issues.Approximately one month after this meeting, someone mailed to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Department of Corrections envelopes containing partial background investigation information on two new DEP employees, both of whom Plaintiff perceived as hired due to favoritism.

After this meeting, Plaintiff emailed Roy Dickey at DEP’s OIG to request whistle-blower status regarding prior issues they had discussed.On January 19, 2007, Plaintiff was questioned by DEP’s OIG and placed on administrative leave with pay while the investigation into the envelopes continued.

During the course of this investigation, it came to the attention of IRS Special Agent Swire that Wenz and Merrick maintained accounts at a number of financial institutions including: the Kemper Money Market Fund, Inc., the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company, the Northern Trust Bank, and the First National Bank of Highland Park. Thus, between February 24 and March 15, 1982, Swire issued civil summonses to these institutions requiring that records pertaining to these taxpayers’ accounts be produced. At the taxpayers’ direction, each of these institutions refused to comply with the summonses.On June 3, 1982 the IRS petitioned the district court to enforce the previously issued summonses. The district court, on June 15, issued an Order to Show Cause with respect to each summons; the orders were returnable on July 28.

At the same time, the taxpayers filed their proposed answers to the IRS petitions for enforcement asserting that the IRS summonses had not been issued as part of a good faith civil investigation, and, further, that the summonses were overbroad because the IRS already possessed many of the records sought.Taxpayers noticed their Motions to Intervene for and brought them before the district court on July 28,1982 — the return date of the Orders to Show Cause. At the show cause hearing on that date, the government expressed its opposition to the motions to intervene on the ground that the motions were untimely. Moreover, the government asked that no discovery be allowed until the court had decided the motions to intervene; this request was granted by the court.Following a second hearing, on August 19,1982, the district court denied taxpayers’ motions to intervene.

Deputy Jefferey Freeman and Reserve Deputy Thomas Payne sought to arrest Mr. Foutch at his home, a trailer situated in a clearing about 100 yards north of a rural road in Bixby, Oklahoma. Because Mr. Foutch had a history of eluding authorities, Deputy Payne stayed in the patrol car and covered the front of the home while Deputy Freeman surveyed the area behind the trailer. Deputy Payne then announced over the patrol car’s loud-speaker that they had a warrant for Mr. Foutch’s arrest and that Mr. Foutch should come out of the house. After Deputy Payne made the announcement a second time, Mr. Foutch’s girlfriend, Butch Shatto, emerged from the trailer and declared that Mr. Foutch was not home. After re-entering the trailer briefly, Ms. Shatto returned and indicated Mr. Foutch was on his way out of the trailer.A few moments later, Deputy Freeman saw a white male dart out the back door and sprint toward the woods behind the house. Deputy Payne joined Deputy Freeman in chasing the suspect when he heard Deputy Freeman shout, “Sheriffs Office, put your hands up!” Out of a concern for their own safety, the deputies, who were unable to identify the streaking figure, chose not to pursue the suspect into the thicket.The deputies asked Ms. Shatto, who had remained on the porch, whether Mr. Foutch, who is white, was the person who had run to the woods. She replied that she did not know. They also asked her if anyone else was still in the home. Ms. Shatto was not sure.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"The underlying allegations in this case arise from what has become popularly known as “Filegate.” Plaintiffs allege that their privacy interests were violated when the FBI improperly handed over to the White House hundreds of FBI files of former political appointees and government employees from the Reagan and Bush Administrations.The court has already held that the circumstances surrounding the release of Linda Tripp’s background security information from the Department of Defense is discoverable to the extent the method of inquiry is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of a White House connection to the release of Tripp’s private government information. See Alexander v. FBI, Civ. No. 96-2123, Memorandum and Order at 6-7 (D.D.C. Apr. 13, 1998). This line of discovery is appropriate because plaintiffs may seek to create the inference that if the White House misused government information for political purposes in the case of the Tripp release, such evidence may be circumstantial evidence of the similar conduct alleged in plaintiffs’ complaint.In pursuing this line of discovery, plaintiffs served Clifford Bernath, former Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, Department of Defense, with subpoenas ad testificandum and duces tecum. Bernath was the person from the Department of Defense that conveyed to a reporter that Tripp had not disclosed a prior arrest on her background security application. Ber-nath was directed to release this information by Kenneth Bacon, Assistant Secretary, Department of Defense. Plaintiffs sought to compel Bernath to re-search his documents pursuant to plaintiffs’ subpoena duces tecum because Bernath had taken an unreasonably narrow view of what constituted responsiveness to the subpoena. In deciding plaintiffs’ motion in that regard as to Bernath, the court noted that Bernath had testified in his deposition: “Every document that I had pertaining to ... Linda Tripp, every document that I had I turned over to the general counsel.” Bernath Depo. at 110. Based on this testimony, the court held that “[plaintiffs may seek to compel the production of responsive, nonprivileged documents that [the Department of Defense] possesses by separate motion. However, at this time, the issue of whether [the Department of Defense] should be compelled to produce additional documents is not properly before the court.” Alexander v. FBI, Civ.

The plaintiffs now have subpoenaed the documents from the Department of Defense, and the Department has produced what it believes are the responsive, nonprivileged documents to the plaintiffs.

(Barrett Aff. ¶ 5).On November 8, 1996, Harwood contacted defendant Scott Smith, a towtruck operator, and asked Smith to assist with the repossession of the truck. (Smith Dep. at 21-22). Harwood told Smith that John had forged her name on certain papers and was behind on truck payments. (Id. at 22). Smith verified with the Department of Motor Vehicles that Harwood was the title owner of the truck, then contacted the Village of Malone Police, concerned that there may be violence at the scene of the repossession. (Id. at 24-25). He was told by a Sergeant Richie that the police could not assure that a patrol would swing by, but that if one became available, it would be sent over. (Id. at 25).Smith arrived at the scene of the repossession. Defendant John Durant arrived a few minutes later, by which time Smith had already hooked up to the truck. (Smith Dep. at 40). John then arrived at the scene and asked Officer Durant what was going on. (Durant Dep. at 14; Barrett Aff. ¶ 11). Officer Durant responded to the effect that the truck was being repossessed for nonpayment. (Durant Dep. at 14; Barrett Aff. ¶ 11). John stated that he had proof that he had made the payments on the truck; Officer Durant replied that he was “only there to keep the peace.” (Smith Dep. at 41; John Barrett Dep. at 66).John then went to get his wife. When Lynne arrived on the scene she attempted to show Officer Durant papers regarding then-right to the truck. (Durant Dep. at 16; Barrett Aff. ¶ 12). Officer Durant responded that this was a civil matter in which he could not get involved. (Durant Dep. at 17; Smith Dep. at 28). Soon thereafter, Harwood arrived on the scene. John and Harwood then became involved in an argument, during which John struck Smith. (John Barrett Dep. at 68-69; Durant Dep. at 18; Smith Dep. at 30). Officer Durant told John that if he struck Smith again, he would be arrested and placed in the squad car. (Lynne Barrett Dep. at 21-22; Durant Dep. at 19; Smith Dep. at 29).Eventually, Smith asked John for the keys to the truck. (Smith Dep. at 30). John gave them to Smith voluntarily, the parties dispersed, and Smith towed the truck to his establishment.

First Union had destroyed the original cancelled checks pursuant to First Union policy and instead issued Smartt copies.Smartt subsequently unleashed a torrent of frivolous litigation that began with a federal lawsuit against First Union and one of its branch managers. The Court dismissed Smartt’s larceny, obliteration of personal property, gross negligence and breach of trust claims with prejudice. Smartt then filed a lawsuit in state circuit court against the same parties, alleging the same facts but claiming damages stemming from negligence, conversion, infliction of emotional distress, fraudulent misrepresentation and obliteration of personal property.While his first state lawsuit was pending, Smartt filed another suit against First Union and a different bank officer, again alleging similar facts. The state court consolidated the cases and dismissed the claims against the new employee. Smartt then filed a Notice of Removal and brought his case back to federal court. The Court granted First Union’s motion for remand and attorneys fees, noting the identical nature of his facts and claims. Upon remand, the state circuit court judge dismissed Smartt’s claims because Smartt forged and perjured evidence.Smartt now appears for the third time before this Court, alleging identical, time-honored facts.

The three have lived together as a family for the last two and one-half years, less times when Johnson was incarcerated or when they lived apart temporarily due to changing apartments.Tremper was arrested on June 22, 2000, on a weapons possession charge. On April 5, 2001,‘she pled guilty to fourth degree criminal possession of a weapon, a .45 caliber Ruger handgun. Tremper admitted that she had purchased the weapon in West Virginia, before her involvement with Johnson, and had transported it to New York State.The weapon had been discovered during an unannounced home visit by Johnson’s probation officers. Possession of a weapon was a violation of Johnson’s probation, and he was subsequently sentenced to ten months imprisonment for that violation. That term of imprisonment has been served. Johnson appears to have a lengthy criminal record, and this was not his first probation violation. Further, a menacing charge is currently pending against him.Subsequent to Tremper’s guilty plea, the defendant Ulster County Department of Probation (“Probation Department”) conducted a presentence investigation report on her and, although this was her first offense, recommended incarceration. In the event the court opted not to follow the recommendation, an Order and Conditions of Probation was provided by the Probation Department. In addition to standard terms of probation, the proposed Order included a special condition: that Tremper refrain from contact with Johnson.Tremper was sentenced on May 31, 2001. The sentencing court did not follow the Probation Department’s recommendation for incarceration. Rather, it placed Tremper on one year interim probation. Under the terms of interim probation, Tremper’s sentencing was adjourned for one year, until May 31, 2002, at which time the court could dismiss the charge, sentence her to incarceration, sentence her to a term of probation, or take other action. The sentencing court signed the Order and Conditions of Probation as proposed by the Probation Department. Tremper also signed, indicating her agreement to abide by its terms. According to Tremper, the first time she became aware that a condition of her probation would be to refrain from contact with Johnson was at the time of her sentencing.This action followed, alleging that the special condition of probation imposed upon Tremper “violates plaintiffs’ privacy and associational rights under principles of substantive due process under the First, Fourth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.” (Am.Comply 23.)

It is undisputed, however, that Petitioner beat Profit with a baseball bat and that Profit subsequently died from the injuries Petitioner inflicted.In his defense. Petitioner argued that Nawab and Profit attacked him in the lobby and that he assaulted them in self-defense. This argument, however, was controverted by the trial testimony of three government witnesses: Linda Na-wab: Willie Turner, the night manager at the hotel; and Deirdre Norwood, the godmother of Turner’s baby. They all testified that Petitioner struck the first blows and that Profit entered the lobby unarmed. Petitioner sought to call Jerry Jackson as a witness, who would have testified that he knew Profit, Turner, and Nawab; that Turner sold drugs to Profit and Nawab; that they were good friends; and that he had seen them together in Profit’s room at the hotel many times. This testimony supposedly would have shown that Turner was biased in favor of Nawab and her version of the events, and that Turner, Norwood, and Nawab were in collusion with one another to secure a guilty verdict.

When Berry failed to report for his scheduled tests, the PSA notified the D.C. Superior Court that he had violated his conditions of release. After a show cause hearing was held on August 14 to determine whether Berry’s bail should be revoked, Berry was released with the same conditions that followed his March and June arrests. He did not report for testing, however, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest on August 24. At a hearing several weeks later, the D.C. Superior Court quashed the warrant and set a $2000 surety bond; Berry was unable to post bond and was jailed.On August 29, 1984, Berry filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Besides making several claims relating to his arrests, Berry claimed that the District’s drug testing and treatment program violated his rights under the Fourth, Fifth and Eighth Amendments. In a memorandum order dated June 14, 1985, the District Court granted the District’s motion for summary judgment with respect to this last claim. Berry v. District of Columbia, No. 84-2659, slip op. at 6-7 (D.D.C. June 14, 1985), R.D. 47. The District Court described Berry’s arguments as “far-fetched,” and stated that his claim did not present issues of “constitutional dimension.” Id. at 6-7. The court merely noted that drug testing and treatment are reasonable conditions of pretrial release. Id. On September 5, 1985, the District Court dismissed Berry’s remaining claims because Berry’s attorney had failed to abide by the court’s orders regarding the management of the case.","{'Sender': 'District’s Pretrial Services Agency (PSA)', 'Sender Role': 'Government Agency', 'Recipient': 'D.C.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"This action is a death penalty habeas case. In 1988, Petitioner Ronaldo Medrano Ayala was found guilty of three counts of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of robbery, and three counts of attempted robbery. This Court has granted Petitioner an evidentiary hearing on certain ineffective assistance of counsel claims and prosecutorial misconduct claims. The evidentiary hearing is currently scheduled to take place in March of 2010.Eric Hart is the author of an unpublished non-fiction book about the Ayala case and the circumstances surrounding the case. The book is based on Hart’s early involvement in the case as an investigator for the Ayala defense team as well as on Hart’s independent investigation after he was no longer working for defense counsel. Hart explains that although the book is non-fiction, it conveys Hart’s opinion or slant regarding the events and evidence. Hart is waiting until after the conclusion of this case to pursue publication of his book.Hart completed his first draft of the book in the 1990s. In 2001, an investigator for Ayala’s counsel in this case called Hart and asked if she could read his manuscript. Hart agreed, and the investigator picked up a copy of the manuscript, which was close to 800 pages. Hart agreed that Ayala’s attorneys could also read the manuscript.Last summer, Hart asked Mr. Belter for the return of the manuscript. Mr. Belter returned the manuscript, but Hart states that as much as one-third of the manuscript was missing. Hart did not keep a copy of the version of the manuscript that was given to the investigator. No electronic version of this manuscript exists because the electronic document was subsequently edited. The manuscript has been re-edited several times. The last edit of the manuscript was in 2005. Hart believes that the portions of the manuscript that pertain to the evidentiary hearing have remained the same throughout the editing process.On September 15, 2009, the Court authorized Respondent to issue a subpoena duces tecum to Mr. Hart to produce any manuscript, book, or draft thereof regarding Petitioner’s case. The Court also issued a protective order, providing that the book was to be used for purposes of the evidentiary hearing and related proceedings only and was not to be duplicated or disclosed to any person.On September 16, 2009, Respondent faxed Hart a copy of the subpoena duces tecum and the Court’s protective order. According to Respondent’s counsel, Hart initially agreed to provide the most recent draft of the book as well as the draft he previously provided to Petitioner’s counsel. However, Hart subsequently objected to the subpoena and indicated that he would not provide any draft of his book.","{'Sender': 'Respondent (court)', 'Sender Role': 'Legal authority', 'Recipient': 'Eric Hart', 'Recipient Role': 'Author/Investigator', 'About': 'Ronaldo Medrano Ayala', 'About Role': 'Defendant', 'Type': 'Manuscript/book', 'Purpose': 'Evidence in an evidentiary hearing', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Court authorization for subpoena', 'Belief': 'The manuscript contains relevant information to the case.'}"
,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"On April 9, 2002, federal and state law enforcement officers executed a federal search warrant for firearms at Brock’s residence, located at 3375 N. Payton Avenue in Indianapolis. The search revealed approximately three pounds of methamphetamine, two pounds of cocaine, one-quarter pound of marijuana, fourteen guns, ammunition, and $35,000 in cash. The officers also found utility bills indicating that Brock paid for at least some of the utilities at 3381 N. Payton Avenue, the house immediately next door, since February 2001. Officer Miller, one of the officers executing the warrant, had training and experience enough to know that drug dealers commonly maintain stash houses to avoid storing all of their inventory in one location.Brock was not home at 3375 N. Payton when the search was conducted. The officers found Godsey instead. According to the officers, Godsey informed them that he and Brock each rented a room next door at 3381 N. Payton. Godsey stated that Brock used 3381 N. Payton as a stash house for drugs and that Brock kept a safe in his bedroom that currently contained several pounds of methamphetamine. Godsey watched both houses for Brock. Godsey consented to a search of his bedroom in 3381 N. Payton and gave the officers a key to the house. The officers found a shotgun in plain view in a common area of the house and some drugs in Godsey’s bedroom as well as papers linking Brock to 3381 N. Payton. Also from a common area, a police narcotics dog alerted to the southwest section of the house.Based on all this information, a state search warrant was obtained and executed for 3381 N. Payton, still on April 2, 2002. A search of Brock’s bedroom uncovered twelve pounds of methamphetamine, eight ounces of cocaine, seven guns, and ammunition. Brock was indicted and convicted on six counts: three for the methamphetamine, cocaine, and firearms found at 3375 N. Payton and three for the methamphetamine, cocaine, and firearms found at 3381 N. Payton. We affirmed the convictions. United States v. Brock, 417 F.3d 692 (7th Cir.2005); United States v. Brock, 433 F.3d 931 (7th Cir.2006).In November 2006, more than three years after Brock was convicted, Brock’s family located Godsey, whose location was previously unknown to the government or Brock. Godsey signed a declaration that he only consented to the search of 3381 N. Payton because the officers held a gun to his head and threatened him with sixty years in prison. Brock then brought this § 2255 motion, which the district court denied.","{'Sender': 'Law enforcement officers', 'Sender Role': 'Federal and state law enforcement officers', 'Recipient': 'Godsey', 'Recipient Role': 'None', 'About': 'Brock', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Private information related to drug possession and use', 'Purpose': 'Investigation and law enforcement', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Godsey (under duress)', 'Belief': 'The officers had reason to believe that Brock used the neighboring house as a stash house based on utility bills and information provided by Godsey.'}"
,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"We take the following factual account from the amended complaint, accepting it as true for present purposes. Paula and Barry Epstein married in 1970, In 2011 Paula filed for divorce in Cook County Circuit Court, accusing her husband of infidelity. The divorce case has dragged on since then and remains unresolved. During discovery Barry’s lawyer sent Paula’s lawyer a document request asking for production of “[a]ny and all communications, documents, e-mails, text messages, photographs, notes, credit card slips, bank statements, or other document whatsoever, which allegedly relate[ ] to [Paula’s allegation of] infidelity.”Jay Frank was Paula’s lawyer. In response to this document request, he produced (among other things) copies of email correspondence between Barry and several women. On the face of it, the messages seem to have been forwarded from Barry’s email accounts to Paula’s. This came as a shock to Barry; he inferred from this discovery response that Paula must have secretly placed a “rule” on his email accounts automatically forwarding his messages to her,With the divorce action still ongoing, Barry filed this federal suit against Paula and Frank pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2520, which authorizes civil actions against persons who violate the Wiretap Act. The complaint alleges that Paula unlawfully intercepted, disclosed, and used Barry’s emails in violation of the Act, and that Frank violated the Act by unlawfully disclosing and using the emails in the divorce proceeding. Copies of some of the intercepted emails were attached to the complaint as exhibits.Paula and Frank separately moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Both argued that intercepting an email doesn’t violate the Wiretap Act unless the acquisition occurs contemporaneously with the email’s transmission. The emails attached to the complaint bear date and time markings showing that they may not have been intercepted contemporaneously with their transmission. The defendants argued that this date and 'time information was enough by itself to defeat Barry’s Wiretap Act claim. Frank also argued that he can’t be liable under the Act for disclosing Barry’s own emails to him in response to his own discovery request in the divorce proceeding.' The judge agreed with these arguments and dismissed the Wiretap Act claims against both, defendants.","{'Sender': 'Barry', 'Sender Role': 'None', 'Recipient': 'Paula', 'Recipient Role': 'None', 'About': 'Barry', 'About Role': 'None', 'Type': 'Emails', 'Purpose': 'Discovery in a divorce proceeding', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"
,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"The FBI rented a hotel suite for Lee in June and December of 1997. The suite consisted of “a sitting room and kitchenette, from which one could walk through a continuously open door, into a bedroom, which also had a bathroom in it.” A496-97. C. Douglas Beavers, the government’s cooperating witness, rented the hotel suite in Lee’s name on behalf of the government and kept a key for himself. However, both Lee and Beavers treated the suite as if it was exclusively Lee’s hotel room.With Beavers’ consent, the FBI concealed a video camera and microphone in the suite after Beavers rented it. The camera could swivel 360 degrees and transmit video images from the living room area and part of the bedroom area of Lee’s suite 24 hours a day. Special Agent Reilly of the FBI monitored the hidden surveillance equipment from an adjacent hotel room the government had rented for that purpose. Reilly could remotely control the camera and equipment in Lee’s suite from her location in the adjoining room. The equipment in Lee’s room continuously transmitted video and audio to the receiving equipment operated by Agent Reilly although she could not receive or record those transmissions unless her equipment was turned on.Agent Reilly testified without contradiction that she did not turn her equipment on or monitor any of the transmissions from Lee’s suite unless Beavers was in the suite with Lee. However, the camera could scan and focus on different areas of Lee’s suite whether or not Beavers was there. See Reply Br. at 4 n. LWhen Beavers visited Lee, he also wore a “body wire” capable of sending audio transmissions to the equipment in Agent Reilly’s adjoining room. However, Beavers’ body transmitter apparently malfunctioned and the FBI was only able to monitor and record audio transmissions by utilizing the microphone and camera hidden inside Lee’s suite. The audio and video recordings that resulted from this surveillance constituted the primary evidence for the only counts on which Lee was convicted.The Government argues that “Beavers’ view of the room was unobstructed, and he could look around the room at will. Nothing was concealed from Beavers that was visible to the camera.” See Appellee’s Br. at 28. However, that claim is not supported by this record, and the district court did not focus on that aspect of Lee’s argument. Instead, it found that Lee had no expectation of privacy in his hotel suite because he admitted Beavers to the room, and Beavers’ presence negated Lee’s Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy under Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966).

The gist of Mr. Riles’ complaint is that the defendants have, without his consent, “engaged in activities with the use[ ] of technology that allow[ ] them to know what he [is] thinking[.]” Id. at 2; see also id. at 4 (complaining that he “will never have a private thought or conversation” so long as defendants continue these alleged activities). Specifically, Mr. Riles claims that the defendants are using mind-reading technology to surveil and investigate his private affairs, including his sexual habits and his financial dealings; to sabotage his relationships; to prevent him from “engaging in his chosen occupation of bookkeeping and tax preparation”; to prevent others from buying his book and interviewing him; and to spread malicious rumors about him. See id. at 2-4. Relatedly, Mr. Riles alleges that the defendants have told him that his parents are dead; that “his son is in their [possession]”; and that they intend to kill him. Id. at 4. According to Mr. Riles, the defendants have violated his fundamental rights, including his right to privacy; denied him his rights to due process and equal protection of the laws; subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment; misappropriated his thoughts without just compensation; and caused him to suffer substantial mental and emotional suffering. See id. at 2-4. He therefore seeks a preliminary injunction to end the defendants’ alleged mind-reading, investigation and harassment. See P.I. Mot. at 1. He also seeks $50,000,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.

Although Plaintiff named thirteen separate Defendants in the caption of the complaint, the body of Plaintiffs complaint only purports to bring suit against Defendants Pressler & Pressler, LLP, Capital One Bank (USA), N.A.

As indicated by a September 7, 2011 letter sent to Plaintiff by Defendant Pressler & Pressler, LLP, it appears that in early August of 2008 Defendant Capital One issued a.MasterCard credit card to Plaintiff and that Plaintiff made payments on ■ this credit card through approximately September 9, 2008.

With respect to Defendants Camden County Special Court and Pressler & Pressler, LLP, Plaintiff alleges that in September of 2010 these Defendants and their agents “initiated a hard pull of Plaintiffs credit report from Equifax without [a] permissible purpose, thereby reducing [Plaintiffs] credit score.” (Pl.’s Compl. [Doc. No. 1] ¶ 8.) Plaintiff further contends that in November of 2009 Defendants Capital One and Pressler & Pressler, LLP “initiated a soft pull of Plaintiffs credit report from Trans Union, Equifax and Exp’erian without [a] permissible purpose.” (Id. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges that “the illegal actions of Defendants [Capital One], Pressler & Pressler, LLP and its agents, [and] Camden County Special Court ... harmed the Plaintiff resulting in credit denials, credit delays, inability to apply for credit, financial loss, loss of use of funds, mental anguish, humiliation, a loss of reputation, and expenditures for attorney’s fees and costs.” (Id. ¶10.)Based on these factual allegations, Plaintiffs complaint asserts eight counts including counts for both willful and negligent non-compliance with FCRA and violations of FDCPA, as well as state law causes of action for reckless and wanton conduct, invasion of privacy — false light, defamation, intentional misrepresentation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"We assume a familiarity with our prior opinions and only briefly sketch the background of the case in order to frame the issue before us. In March 2000, the City submitted a formal FOIA request to ATF for certain local and national Trace Database and Multiple Sales Database information. ATF complied with the request in part, but it refused to disclose a significant portion of the information requested, claiming that it was protected under FOIA exemptions for privacy and law enforcement purposes. The City then filed this federal suit under FOIA in pursuit of the withheld information. The district court granted the City’s motion for summary judgment, ordered ATF to disclose the information, and stayed the order pending appeal.On April 25, 2002, we affirmed the district court’s ruling on the ground that none of the FOIA exemptions justified withholding the data. City of Chicago v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, 287 F.3d 628, amended on denial of rehearing, 297 F.3d 672 (7th Cir.2002) (“City of Chicago I”). ATF filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and the Supreme Court granted the petition. Dep’t of Treasury v. City of Chicago, 537 U.S. 1018, 123 S.Ct. 536, 154 L.Ed.2d 424 (2002). Congress then passed the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003, which contained a rider prohibiting the use of appropriated funds “to take any action based upon any provision of [the FOIA] with respect to” the databases in question here. Pub.L. No. 108-7, § 644, 117 Stat. 11 (2003). The Supreme Court vacated the judgment of this court and remanded the case to determine “what effect, if any,” the rider had on the case. Dep’t of Justice v. City of Chicago, 537 U.S. 1229, 123 S.Ct. 1352, 154 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2003). After the remand but before oral argument, Congress passed another appropriations rider that prohibited the use of appropriated funds “to disclose to the public” the firearms trace or multiple sales data. Pub.L. No. 108-199, 118 Stat. 3 (2004). On remand, we again found in favor of the City, concluding that the riders precluded the use of funding to retrieve the data but did not alter the City’s right to access the information. City of Chicago v. United States Dep’t of Treasury, 384 F.3d 429 (7th Cir.2004) (“City of Chicago II”). To alleviate the funding problem, we took the City up on its suggestion to appoint a special master to retrieve the data from ATF at the City’s cost.ATF filed a petition for rehearing with a suggestion for a rehearing en banc. While that petition was pending, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, which contained yet another rider provision pertaining to the ATF sales and tracing databases. To consider the effect of this new law, we granted ATF’s petition to the extent it requested a panel rehearing.","{'Sender': 'The City of Chicago', 'Sender Role': 'Plaintiff', 'Recipient': 'ATF', 'Recipient Role': 'Defendant', 'About': 'Local and national Trace Database and Multiple Sales Database information', 'About Role': 'Not Applicable', 'Type': 'Private information', 'Purpose': 'Pursuit of information through federal suit under FOIA', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'Not Applicable', 'Belief': 'None'}"
