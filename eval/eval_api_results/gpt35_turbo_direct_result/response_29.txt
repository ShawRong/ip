### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the release of Josh Sanchez's SSODA evaluation to the King County Sheriffâ€™s Office. The evaluation contains sensitive medical and psychological information about Sanchez, which is protected under HIPAA regulations. This rule ensures the privacy of individuals' health information and restricts its disclosure without proper authorization. Therefore, in this case, the release of the SSODA evaluation would not be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
