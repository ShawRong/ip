### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the unauthorized disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) to third parties. In this case, the unauthorized disclosure of the Privileged Supplement containing individual medical claims and records, which constitutes PHI, goes against the strict privacy restrictions mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). It is crucial to uphold the privacy and confidentiality of plan members' health information as outlined in the HIPAA regulations.
