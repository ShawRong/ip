### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the actions taken by the defense counsel in this case. The disclosure of detailed medical opinions without the patient's consent violates the confidentiality and privacy standards set forth by HIPAA, undermining the protection of private health information and breaching the fiduciary relationship between the patient and his physician.
