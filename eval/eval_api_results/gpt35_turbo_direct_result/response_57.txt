The sharing of the Appellee's medical records with law enforcement without his consent, as facilitated by the grand jury subpoena, would likely be forbidden by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. HIPAA generally prohibits the disclosure of protected health information without the individual's authorization, except in certain specific circumstances. In this case, the transfer of the Appellee's medical records for a criminal investigation without his consent does not seem to align with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
