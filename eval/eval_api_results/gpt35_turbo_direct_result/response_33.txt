### Response:
The actions described in the case **Forbid** the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The unauthorized access of personal medical information of USPS employees by OIG agents without their knowledge or consent violates the privacy rights guaranteed by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. While the OIG agents cited their oversight authority, the lack of consent from the individuals and the secretive nature of obtaining this information raise significant concerns about the legality and ethicality of their actions. In this context, the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not permit such practices that compromise the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' health information.
