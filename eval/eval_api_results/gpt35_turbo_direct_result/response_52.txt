### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of James A1 White's HIV status in this case. The disclosure of sensitive health information without the patient's consent for the purpose of legal proceedings goes against the typical privacy protections provided by HIPAA regulations. While there are exceptions for disclosures required by law, this situation does not seem to fall within those permissible boundaries.
