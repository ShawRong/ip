### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI) in the described case. The defendant raised valid concerns about protecting the privacy of non-party information under laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), specifically citing 45 CFR ยง 164.530(c)(2) for safeguarding PHI. Given the broad scope of the discovery requests and the sensitivity of the information involved, disclosing Personal disclosing Personal Injury Protection (PIP) files) files and related communications containing PHI of potentially hundreds of policyholders would likely violate HIPAA regulations designed to protect individuals individuals' health informationh information privacy.
