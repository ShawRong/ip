### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Permits** the scenario described in the case involving Kelly Regian. This is because the release of protected health information, as outlined in the authorization form for the health care liability claim, falls under the permissible uses and disclosures allowed by HIPAA for purposes of investigating and evaluating the health care claim and defending against any resulting litigation.
