### Response:
The actions taken by Ross Cashen's legal team to obtain Jane Doe's mental health records without her consent **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The HIPAA Privacy Rule strictly protects an individual's privacy rights regarding their health information, prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure or access to such sensitive data. Obtaining someone's mental health records without their explicit consent violates the privacy rights guaranteed by the HIPAA regulations.
