### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the disclosure of the decedent's roommate's information in this case, under a strict "qualified protective order." This decision by the court balanced the legal necessity of the disclosure for the malpractice case with the privacy protections outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
