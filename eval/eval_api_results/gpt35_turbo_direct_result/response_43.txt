### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the case described in the scenario. The unauthorized sale of de-identified patient information by CVS Caremark Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. to pharmaceutical companies and third-party data firms goes against the core principles of patient privacy and confidentiality outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Despite the information being de-identified, the unauthorized sharing and profiting from the data without patient consent violate the expectations of privacy and control over personal health information established by HIPAA regulations.
