### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of Esther A. Broderick's medical records in this case. Since there was no consent provided by Broderick or a legally authorized representative for this specific disclosure, and the request for the medical records pertains to a legal dispute over Broderick's will, which involves questioning her mental competence, the disclosure would not be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The sensitive nature of medical information and the lack of explicit consent or legal basis for disclosure in this scenario would make it impermissible under HIPAA regulations.
