### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the sharing of Protected Health Information (PHI) in this case without proper authorization or legal basis. Sharing sensitive PHI with entities not directly involved in healthcare operations, without the necessary safeguards, violates HIPAA regulations aimed at protecting patient privacy and confidentiality.
