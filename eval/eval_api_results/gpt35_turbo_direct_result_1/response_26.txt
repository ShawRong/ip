### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of the requested medical data without individual player authorization. The U.S. NHL Clubs, as healthcare providers, must adhere to the privacy standards outlined in HIPAA, which necessitate obtaining explicit consent before releasing sensitive medical information. Despite the plaintiffs' intentions to leverage this data for legal purposes, the Clubs are obligated to protect the privacy rights of the players involved, highlighting the importance of balancing confidentiality with legal obligations in the context of litigation.
