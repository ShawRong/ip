### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the limited ex parte communications with Mary's health care providers under the qualified protective order granted by the court. This permission is based on the need to gather information directly relevant to the medical malpractice lawsuit while balancing the protection of Mary's private health information.
