### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the sharing of detailed health plan information, especially individual claims experience and identities of covered dependents, as described in the case. This is because disclosing such information could potentially infringe on the privacy of city employees and their families, violating the expectations of privacy guaranteed under state laws and breaching federal regulations that protect personal health information from unauthorized access.
