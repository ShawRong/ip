To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the steps outlined in the instruction.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.512(a)(2)) and Their Content

**HIPAA Regulation 164.512(a)(2)** states that a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) without the individual's authorization for specific purposes, including disclosures required by law. This provision allows for disclosures to law enforcement when the disclosure is required by law or when there is a valid legal mandate.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, the pharmacy disclosed the Appellee's prescription records to a law enforcement officer based on section 893.07(4) of the Florida Statutes, which mandates that pharmacies make such records available to law enforcement for inspection and copying. This scenario aligns with the provisions of HIPAA, specifically 164.512(a)(2), as the disclosure was made in compliance with state law.

#### Key Points:
- **Required by Law**: The pharmacy's action was in accordance with state law, which is a recognized reason under HIPAA for disclosing PHI without patient consent.
- **No Violation of Privacy**: Since the disclosure was mandated by law and not subject to the requirement of patient consent, the action does not violate HIPAA.
- **Law Enforcement Role**: The involvement of law enforcement in this context is also supported by the need to investigate illegal activity, which is a legitimate purpose under HIPAA.

### Conclusion

The case complies with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The pharmacyâ€™s disclosure of the Appellee's prescription records to law enforcement was permitted under HIPAA regulation 164.512(a)(2) because it was required by state law. Therefore, the actions taken were lawful and did not constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
