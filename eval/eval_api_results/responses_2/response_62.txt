To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the specified steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.502(j)(2)(ii)) and Their Content

**HIPAA Regulation 164.502(j)(2)(ii)** states:
- A covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) without the individual's authorization when required by law, including complying with a court order or a subpoena issued by a court. 

This regulation emphasizes that while patient privacy is crucial, there are circumstances under which PHI can be disclosed, particularly when mandated by legal authorities.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, the State obtained a search warrant to access Charles R. Black's medical records following an alleged crime. Hereâ€™s how it fits under the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Legal Requirement**: The State's search warrant constitutes a legal requirement under HIPAA. As per 164.502(j)(2)(ii), disclosures made in compliance with a search warrant are permitted without the individual's authorization.

2. **Scope of Disclosure**: The warrant specifically requested records for a defined period (April 7 to April 15, 2011) related to Charles's treatment following the alleged assault. This aligns with the stipulations of HIPAA regarding disclosures made for law enforcement purposes.

3. **Charles's Concerns**: Charles contends that the method of obtaining his medical records via a search warrant, rather than a subpoena, was improper. However, HIPAA does not differentiate between these methods in terms of permitting disclosure in the context of law enforcement; both are recognized as legal mechanisms for obtaining PHI.

### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the State's action to obtain Charles's medical records through the search warrant. As such, while Charles has raised concerns about the manner of obtaining his records, the disclosure itself is compliant with HIPAA regulations, given that it was conducted pursuant to a lawful court order. Therefore, the case aligns with the legal provisions outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
