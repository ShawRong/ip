To assess whether the case complies with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, let's follow the outlined steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs

- **164.502(j)(2)(ii)**: This section discusses the conditions under which a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) when required by law. It allows disclosure to the extent that it is required by law and the covered entity must comply with the law.

- **160.314(a)**: This section pertains to the requirements for a covered entity to have safeguards in place to protect the privacy of PHI. It emphasizes the need for policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Privacy Rule.

### Step 2: Determine Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule

In this case, the following points are relevant:

1. **Disclosure for Legal Purposes**: The hospital disclosed Rodriguez's medical records, including blood test results, in response to a grand jury subpoena. According to HIPAA regulations, disclosures required by law, such as a subpoena, can be permissible. Thus, the hospital was acting within its rights to comply with the subpoena.

2. **Patient Consent**: While Rodriguez did not consent to the release of his information, HIPAA allows for certain disclosures without patient consent when required by law. The grand jury subpoena likely qualifies as such a legal requirement.

3. **Legitimate Purpose**: The purpose of the disclosure was for law enforcement to gather evidence for a DWI charge, which aligns with the legitimate purposes outlined in HIPAA.

### Conclusion

Based on the regulations checked, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of Rodriguez's medical information in this context, as it was made in compliance with a legal requirement (the grand jury subpoena). Therefore, the case does not appear to violate HIPAA provisions, as the disclosure was both legally mandated and in line with the intended use of the information for law enforcement purposes.
