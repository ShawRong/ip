To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the specified steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs 
The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs concerning the Privacy Rule include:

- **45 CFR ยง 164.502**: General Rules for Uses and Disclosures of PHI
- **45 CFR ยง 164.512**: Uses and Disclosures for which consent, an authorization, or opportunity to agree or object is not required
- **45 CFR ยง 164.514**: Other Requirements Relating to Uses and Disclosures of PHI

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, several factors must be considered regarding the disclosure of protected health information (PHI):

1. **Judicial Proceedings**: Under **45 CFR ยง 164.512(e)**, HIPAA permits the disclosure of PHI in the context of judicial proceedings. This is applicable when a court order or subpoena is issued. Since Dr. Vabnick-Wener secured a protective order for depositions, this action appears to align with the regulations allowing for such disclosures.

2. **Need for Information**: The legal representation for Dr. Vabnick-Wener and her colleagues necessitates sharing information related to the patient (Arlie Alexander) as part of the wrongful death lawsuit. This sharing must be limited to the minimum necessary information to achieve the legal purpose, which is also supported under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Patient's Rights**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule emphasizes the patient's right to privacy and control over their health information. However, when legal proceedings are involved, the need for relevant medical information often supersedes these rights, provided that the disclosures are compliant with HIPAA regulations.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the case and the applicable HIPAA regulations:

- The disclosures made among the medical professionals and to the legal team for the purpose of the wrongful death lawsuit appear to be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as they fall under the exceptions for judicial proceedings.
- It is essential that all parties involved adhere to the minimum necessary standard and ensure that any shared information is relevant to the case.

Thus, the case is compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, assuming all other procedural safeguards and minimum necessary disclosures are properly followed.
