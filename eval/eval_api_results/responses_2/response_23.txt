To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs and Their Content
The HIPAA Privacy Rule primarily consists of regulations that protect individuals' medical records and personal health information. Key provisions include:

- **45 CFR ยง 164.502**: This section outlines the general rules for the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). It specifies that PHI may only be used or disclosed with the individual's consent, except in certain situations.

- **45 CFR ยง 164.512**: This section details circumstances under which PHI may be disclosed without consent, such as for public health activities, judicial and administrative proceedings, or to avert a serious threat to health or safety.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case
In A.M.'s case, the following points are relevant:

1. **Consent Revocation**: A.M. initially consented to the release of her medical information but later revoked that consent. Under HIPAA, once consent is revoked, any further disclosure of her PHI without explicit consent would generally be prohibited.

2. **Investigator's Role**: Douglas Bernard, as an investigator, is attempting to gather information about A.M.'s health and financial situation. While he may have a legitimate interest in her well-being, any disclosure of her medical information without her consent could violate HIPAA unless a specific exception applies.

3. **Court Involvement**: The court's role introduces a potential exception under 45 CFR ยง 164.512(e), which allows for disclosures in the context of judicial proceedings. If the court orders the release of A.M.'s medical information, it may be permissible under HIPAA, provided it complies with the requirements for such disclosures.

4. **Protective Services**: If there is a belief that A.M. is at risk of abuse or neglect, this concern might justify a disclosure under the public interest or to avert a serious threat to her health or safety (45 CFR ยง 164.512(j)). However, this would still require careful consideration of whether A.M.'s rights and autonomy are being respected.

### Conclusion
The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally forbids the disclosure of A.M.'s medical information without her consent after it has been revoked. However, there are exceptions for judicial proceedings and public health concerns that might apply in this situation. The legal and ethical implications of pursuing information about A.M.'s health without her consent must be carefully balanced against her rights and the need for protective services. Ultimately, any further action should ideally involve legal counsel to ensure compliance with HIPAA and respect for A.M.'s autonomy.
