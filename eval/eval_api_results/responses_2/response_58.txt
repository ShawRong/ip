To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.504(e)(2)(ii)(E))

The relevant section of the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.504(e)(2)(ii)(E)) pertains to the conditions under which a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) to a business associate. Specifically, it allows for the disclosure of PHI without patient authorization if the business associate is providing services that involve the use or disclosure of PHI, provided there is a written contract ensuring that the business associate will protect the information.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In the case presented, patient advocates from Legal Aid of West Virginia have historically been allowed unrestricted access to patient health records to perform their advocacy roles. However, the policy change in June 2014 now requires these advocates to obtain signed releases from patients or their legal representatives before accessing any health records. 

#### Compliance Analysis:

1. **Access to PHI**: The initial unrestricted access could be justified under HIPAA if the advocates were acting as business associates in a manner that aligned with patient care and advocacy, provided there was a contractual agreement to protect PHI.

2. **New Policy Requirements**: The requirement for signed releases from patients indicates a stricter adherence to patient privacy standards. This aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's emphasis on patient consent before disclosing PHI, which is a fundamental aspect of the rule.

3. **Patient Advocacy Impact**: The advocates' role is vital in protecting patient rights and ensuring oversight against abuse and neglect. However, the new policy reflects a shift towards prioritizing patient privacy, which is a legal obligation under HIPAA.

4. **Balancing Privacy and Advocacy**: The core issue lies in balancing the legitimate need for oversight against the requirement for patient consent. While the advocates aim to improve care and prevent abuse, the legal framework mandates stringent controls on the access and use of PHI.

### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule, as outlined in 164.504(e)(2)(ii)(E), permits the disclosure of PHI under certain conditions, typically involving business associates. However, the new policy implemented by the DHHR, which requires signed patient releases for accessing records, emphasizes the importance of patient consent and privacy. This policy is in line with HIPAA requirements, suggesting that while patient advocacy is crucial, it must operate within the constraints of privacy laws. Therefore, the current situation, while challenging for advocates, is compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
