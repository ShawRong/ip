To assess compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule based on the provided case, we will follow the specified steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs

1. **164.502(d)(1)**: This regulation pertains to the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. It emphasizes that covered entities must limit the use of PHI to the minimum necessary to achieve the intended purpose, and it discusses the importance of obtaining patient consent for certain disclosures.

2. **164.502(a)(5)(ii)(B)**: This regulation allows for the use of de-identified health information for various purposes, provided that the de-identification process meets the standards outlined in HIPAA. De-identified information, which does not allow for the identification of individuals, is not considered PHI, and thus can be used more freely without the same restrictions as identifiable information.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, CVS pharmacies are accused of selling de-identified prescription information to third parties. The key points to consider are:

- **De-identified Information**: If the information truly meets the criteria for de-identification as defined by HIPAA, it is not classified as PHI. This means that CVS could legally sell such information without violating HIPAA, provided that the de-identification was done correctly and fully in accordance with HIPAA standards.

- **Patient Expectations and Consent**: The plaintiffs argue that they did not consent to the sale of their de-identified information and that this practice breaches their expectations of privacy. While HIPAA does allow for the use of de-identified data without consent, the ethical implications and expectations of patients regarding their health information may still be a point of contention.

- **Legitimate Business Activities**: CVS's defense hinges on the argument that such data transactions are part of legitimate business operations. If the data is de-identified and used for purposes that do not allow for individual identification, this could be seen as compliant with HIPAA.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis:

- **Permissibility**: If CVS is accurately de-identifying the information and adhering to HIPAA's requirements, the sale of such data would not violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 

- **Consideration for Ethical Practices**: However, the case raises ethical questions about patient expectations and consent, which, while not directly covered by HIPAA, could influence public perception and trust in healthcare entities.

Ultimately, while HIPAA may permit the actions described if the information is properly de-identified, the case underscores a complex intersection of legal compliance and ethical responsibility in handling patient information.
