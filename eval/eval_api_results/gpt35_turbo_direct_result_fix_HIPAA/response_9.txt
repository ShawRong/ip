Based on the provided case involving Randolph Koch and his healthcare information being disclosed to the SEC, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the outlined steps:

1. **Checking HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content**:
   - The relevant HIPAA regulation to consider in this case is 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.508(b)(5)(I), which pertains to the patient's right to revoke authorization except where actions have been taken based on that authorization.

2. **Determining Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case**:
   - In this scenario, the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows patients to revoke authorization for the release of their health information. Koch revoked his authorization before the subpoena was served to Aron, indicating his intent to maintain the confidentiality of his psychotherapy records. The district court's ruling on implied waiver was contested by Koch, emphasizing that his actions did not constitute an express waiver of the psychotherapist-patient privilege.

3. **Answer**: Permit

In conclusion, based on the details provided, the case involving Randolph Koch appears to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule as he exercised his right to revoke authorization for the release of his psychotherapy records, emphasizing the importance of patient privacy and confidentiality in healthcare settings.
