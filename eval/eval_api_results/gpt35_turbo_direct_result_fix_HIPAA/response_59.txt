### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content:** The case involves the disclosure of medical records and blood-test results from a healthcare provider to a government entity (District Attorney's Office) without the patient's consent.
   
2. **Permit or Forbid:** The disclosure of medical information without patient consent in response to a grand jury subpoena raises concerns regarding HIPAA compliance, particularly with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. While HIPAA allows for certain disclosures without patient authorization in response to legal processes like subpoenas, it is crucial to ensure that such disclosures comply with the minimum necessary standard and other relevant provisions of the Privacy Rule.

3. **Conclusion:** In this case, the disclosure of Rodriguez's medical records and blood-test results to the District Attorney's Office without his consent is a complex issue. While the disclosure was initiated in response to a legal process (grand jury subpoena) for law enforcement purposes, the compliance should be carefully assessed to ensure it aligns with HIPAA's Privacy Rule requirements, especially regarding the minimum necessary standard and the safeguarding of patient privacy rights.

Therefore, the compliance assessment with the HIPAA Privacy Rule in this case is crucial to determine whether the disclosure was permissible or forbidden under the law.
