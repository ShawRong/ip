### Response:

Following the provided case study, let's assess it for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Step 1:** Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:
   - The relevant HIPAA regulation cited in the case is 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.502, governing the use and disclosure of protected health information.

2. **Step 2:** Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:
   - In this scenario, regarding the access to medical records of deceased residents by spouses and attorneys-in-fact, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the denial of access to parties who do not meet the criteria of "personal representatives" as defined under HIPAA regulations.

3. **Step 3:** Please use Permit or Forbid to answer:
   - **Forbid**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the nursing facilities from releasing the medical records in this case to spouses and attorneys-in-fact who do not qualify as "personal representatives" under HIPAA regulations. 

This assessment aligns with the facilities' interpretation of federal regulations and their commitment to safeguarding patient confidentiality under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
