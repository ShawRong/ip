### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs Checked:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule
   - HIPAA Regulation Content: The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determination:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without patient consent, unless an exception applies.

3. **Assessment:** In this case, Trooper Abdullah's actions raise concerns regarding HIPAA compliance. While the pursuit of evidence for a criminal investigation is crucial, the disclosure of Peltz's BAC levels without his explicit consent violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Patient privacy rights should have been respected, and proper legal procedures followed to obtain this information in a manner consistent with HIPAA regulations.
