### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content Check:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found under 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determination of Compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - In this case, the disclosure of David Evenson's psychotherapy notes by his therapist, Georgia Howorth-Fair, raises concerns under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally permits the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. However, the disclosure of psychotherapy notes is subject to stricter standards.

3. **Compliance Assessment:**
   - Howorth-Fair's resistance to releasing the psychotherapy notes, despite a court order and Lori Evenson's consent, indicates a potential violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - Psychotherapy notes are treated as sensitive information under HIPAA and require specific authorization for disclosure.

4. **Conclusion: Permit or Forbid**
   - **Forbid**: Howorth-Fair's withholding of the psychotherapy notes, even after a court order and consent, likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule unless specific exceptions or authorizations apply.

5. **Recommendation:**
   - It is advisable for Howorth-Fair to review the HIPAA Privacy Rule and consult legal counsel to ensure compliance with privacy regulations while balancing legal obligations in this complex situation.
