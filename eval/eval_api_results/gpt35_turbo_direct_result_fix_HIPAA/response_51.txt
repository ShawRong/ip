Based on the information provided in the case of Kanay Mubita, we can assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule is designed to protect patients' sensitive health information.
   - Relevant regulations include 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, which establish the standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, the disclosure of Kanay Mubita's health information to the Latah County Prosecutor’s Office without his consent raises significant privacy concerns.
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally prohibits the disclosure of protected health information without authorization, except in specific circumstances outlined in the regulation.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer:**
   - The disclosure of Mubita's health records to the Prosecutor’s Office without his explicit consent likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - **Answer: Forbid**

In summary, based on the provided information and the principles of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the disclosure of Kanay Mubita's health records without his consent appears to be in violation of HIPAA regulations.
