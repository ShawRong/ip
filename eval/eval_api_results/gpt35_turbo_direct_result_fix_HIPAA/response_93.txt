Based on the provided case involving Mary Jane Simon, an 82-year-old woman who experienced a fall at Specialty Orthopaedics, P.C.'s Wellness Center, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be conducted as follows:

**Step 1:** Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content to understand the specific provisions related to protected health information (PHI) and privacy.

**Step 2:** Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the release of the identities of potential eyewitnesses in this case.

**Step 3:** Please use Permit or Forbid to answer.

In this scenario, the legal team sought the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of potential eyewitnesses as part of the discovery process to build a case against the Wellness Center for negligence. The Wellness Center initially resisted providing this information, citing privacy laws.

Based on the court's ultimate decision that the information did not constitute protected health information under HIPAA, it can be concluded that the HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the release of the identities of potential eyewitnesses in this case for the purpose of legal discovery and litigation.

Therefore, the case is compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulations.
