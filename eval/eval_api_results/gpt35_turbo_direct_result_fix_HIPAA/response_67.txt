### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**

3. **Assessment:**
   - In the case described, the sharing of Mr. Beaty's medical information with Dr. Weinstein for legal defense purposes without his specific authorization raises concerns regarding HIPAA compliance.
   
4. **Conclusion:**
   - The ex parte sharing of Mr. Beaty's medical records in this context may not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements, as it lacks explicit patient consent for this specific use.
   
5. **Answer:**
   - **Forbid**: Based on the information provided, the sharing of Mr. Beaty's medical information with Dr. Weinstein without his specific authorization for legal defense purposes likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
