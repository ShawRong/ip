Based on the provided case, let's assess it for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Step 1**: Checking the HIPAA regulation IDs and their content, we find that the relevant regulation here is the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164). This rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Step 2**: Considering the actions described in the case, it is evident that the handling of the individuals' sensitive information by the EMS and the contracted third-party companies did not comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The systematic unauthorized access and sharing of protected health data clearly violated the privacy and security requirements mandated by HIPAA.

3. **Step 3**: In conclusion, based on the assessment, the actions described in the case unequivocally **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

This case highlights a serious breach of patient confidentiality and underscores the importance of stringent adherence to HIPAA regulations to safeguard individuals' sensitive health information.
