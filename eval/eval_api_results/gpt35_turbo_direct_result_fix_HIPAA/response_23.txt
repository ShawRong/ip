### Response:

1. **Checking HIPAA Regulation IDs and content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 160 and 164) establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determining if the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - **Answer:** Forbid

Explanation:
- The case of A.M. falls under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which protects the privacy of individuals' health information.
- Despite the concerning circumstances surrounding A.M.'s well-being, her right to privacy and control over her medical information is paramount.
- A.M. initially consented to release her medical information to Dr. Priem but later revoked this consent, indicating her desire for privacy.
- Without explicit consent from A.M., sharing her private information, especially concerning her mental and physical health, would not comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Therefore, based on the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the case of A.M. should be considered as "Forbid" in terms of sharing her information without her explicit consent.
