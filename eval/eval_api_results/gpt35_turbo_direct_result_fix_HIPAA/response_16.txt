### Response:

After reviewing the provided case, it is essential to assess the scenario for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Let's break down the steps outlined for this evaluation:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:** 
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found in 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - Given the situation described in the case, where confidential medical information was disclosed without the patient's consent to bolster a legal defense, it is clear that this action violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   
3. **Answer - Permit or Forbid:**
   - **Forbid:** The actions taken by the defense counsel, which involved disclosing detailed medical opinions and information without the patient's consent, go against the fundamental principles of patient privacy and confidentiality outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

In summary, the disclosure of sensitive medical information without patient consent, as described in the case, is not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and is considered a violation of patient privacy rights.
