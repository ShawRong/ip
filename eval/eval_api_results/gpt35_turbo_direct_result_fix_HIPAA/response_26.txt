Based on the provided case involving former NHL players seeking medical records from U.S. NHL Clubs without direct consent, we need to assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found in 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - **Answer:** Forbid
   - **Reasoning:** The case involves the disclosure of sensitive medical information without direct consent from the individuals (former players) whose records are being sought. HIPAA generally requires patient authorization for the release of medical records, and in this scenario, the U.S. NHL Clubs are rightly concerned about violating medical privacy laws by providing such data without explicit consent.

Therefore, the compliance assessment with the HIPAA Privacy Rule indicates that the case, as described, would likely be forbidden under HIPAA regulations due to the lack of individual consent for the release of sensitive medical information.
