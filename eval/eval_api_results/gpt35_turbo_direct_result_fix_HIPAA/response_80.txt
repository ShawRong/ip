Based on the provided case details, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs Checked:** The case involves the disclosure of medical records, particularly psychotherapy notes, which are usually highly protected under HIPAA regulations for maintaining confidentiality.

2. **Determination of Compliance:** In this scenario, despite the usual protection of psychotherapy notes, the plaintiff explicitly authorized the release of her medical information, including these notes, for use in the lawsuit. The court also considered the federal legal framework under 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.508(a)(2) and ยง 164.512(e), which allow for disclosures in legal proceedings under certain conditions.

3. **Compliance Assessment:** The disclosure of the psychotherapy notes in this case is permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the explicit authorization provided by the plaintiff and the specific legal context of the lawsuit. Therefore, the action taken in disclosing the records aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Conclusion:
The disclosure of the psychotherapy notes in this legal scenario is permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the plaintiff's explicit authorization and the legal framework governing the case.
