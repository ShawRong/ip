Based on the provided case of CVS Caremark Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. selling de-identified prescription information to pharmaceutical companies and third-party data firms without patient consent, we need to assess this case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Step 1:
The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) to check for this case would include:
- HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164)

### Step 2:
After reviewing the case details, it is evident that the actions of CVS Caremark Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. in selling de-identified prescription information might raise concerns regarding HIPAA compliance. The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally allows for the use and disclosure of de-identified health information without patient authorization. However, for information to be considered de-identified under HIPAA, it must meet certain criteria to prevent re-identification.

### Step 3:
In this case, the practice of selling de-identified prescription information without patient consent raises questions about whether the de-identification process was robust enough to protect patient privacy. It is essential to further investigate the specifics of how the de-identification was carried out and whether it aligns with HIPAA requirements.

### Conclusion:
While the sale of de-identified health information is generally permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, it is crucial to ensure that proper safeguards are in place to protect patient privacy and comply with HIPAA regulations. Further examination of the de-identification process and the specifics of how patient information was handled by CVS Caremark Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. would be necessary to determine if their actions comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
