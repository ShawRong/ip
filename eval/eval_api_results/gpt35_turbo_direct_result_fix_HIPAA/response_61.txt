Based on the provided case involving Kevin Dwayne Kennemur, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule would unfold as follows:

1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content**: The case involves the disclosure of Kennemur's private health information from Yoakum County Hospital to law enforcement officials without his consent. This implicates several HIPAA regulations, particularly those concerning the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI), as well as the rules around disclosures for law enforcement purposes (45 CFR ยง 164.512(f)).

2. **Determining Compliance**: In this scenario, the disclosure of Kennemur's medical records and blood alcohol test results without his consent was made to aid law enforcement in establishing a link between his intoxication and the fatal accident for the purpose of a criminal investigation. According to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered entities may disclose PHI to law enforcement without an individual's authorization in certain circumstances, including when required by law (45 CFR ยง 164.512(f)).

3. **Conclusion**: In this case, although the disclosure was made without Kennemur's consent, it appears to be compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule under the provision that allows disclosures to law enforcement when required by law. Therefore, the action of sharing Kennemur's private health information with law enforcement officials can be considered permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The response to whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids this specific case would be: **Permit**.
