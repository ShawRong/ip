### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164) governs the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI).
   
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The actions described in the case, where OIG agents accessed USPS employees' medical information without their knowledge or consent, likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   
3. **Answer: Forbid**
   
   The actions taken by the OIG agents to access the medical information without consent appear to violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which requires the protection of individuals' health information and outlines specific circumstances under which it can be accessed. This case seems to go against the fundamental principle of patient privacy and consent mandated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
