Step 1: The HIPAA regulation IDs related to this case are not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. However, the case involves the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) for the purpose of investigating and evaluating a health care liability claim. This would likely implicate several provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including those related to the use and disclosure of PHI for treatment, payment, and health care operations (TPO), as well as the requirements for patient authorization for disclosure.

Step 2: Considering the scenario where Kelly Regian and her husband sent Dr. Collins a written notice of their health care liability claim, which included an authorization form for the release of protected health information, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely permit this disclosure. The authorization form appears to align with the requirements of the Privacy Rule by specifying the purpose of disclosure, the entities involved, and the scope of information being released. As long as the disclosure is limited to what is necessary for investigating and defending against the claim, it should comply with HIPAA regulations.

Step 3: Based on the provided details, the disclosure of Kelly Regian's protected health information through the authorization form for the purpose of investigating and evaluating a health care liability claim would be considered **Permit** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
