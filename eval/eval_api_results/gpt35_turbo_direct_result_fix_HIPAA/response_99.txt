Based on the provided case description, let's assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   The case involves the disclosure of physical and mental health records of witnesses housed within the New Mexico Corrections Department (NMCD) system. These health records are considered Protected Health Information (PHI) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   The HIPAA Privacy Rule strictly regulates the disclosure of PHI. In this case, the health records of the witnesses cannot be disclosed without individual consent or a court order, aligning with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Answer - Forbid:**
   Given the stringent requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule regarding the disclosure of health information without proper consent or legal authorization, the case is forbidden from accessing and disclosing the witnesses' health records without following the necessary legal procedures outlined in the rule.

Therefore, the case's request to access and disclose the health records of the witnesses without individual consent or a court order does not comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule and is forbidden under its regulations.
