Based on the provided scenario, let's assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content**: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information. It sets standards for the confidentiality and security of health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**: In this case, the state utilized a grand jury subpoena to obtain the results of the blood-alcohol test conducted at the hospital without Murray's consent. Murray argued that his medical records were protected under HIPAA, implying a reasonable expectation of privacy.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally permits the disclosure of protected health information without authorization for certain purposes, such as for law enforcement activities under specific circumstances. However, the disclosure must comply with HIPAA regulations, including ensuring that the minimum necessary information is disclosed.

### Response:
Based on the provided information, in this case, the disclosure of Murray's medical information through the grand jury subpoena could potentially be permitted under HIPAA regulations if it meets the criteria for disclosure to law enforcement. However, the specific details of the disclosure and whether it complies with HIPAA requirements would need to be carefully assessed to make a definitive determination.
