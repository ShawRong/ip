### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and their Content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule: The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It applies to health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically.
  
2. **Determination of Compliance:**
   - The case involving Greg Shepherd raises concerns regarding the unauthorized disclosure of his health information related to the Erectile Dysfunction (E.D.) medication. Despite Shepherd's explicit refusal of the E.D. medication and Costco's acknowledgment of his cancellation requests, the prescription was still disclosed to his ex-wife, impacting his privacy.

3. **Compliance Assessment:**
   - **Verdict:** Forbid
   - **Reasoning:** The unauthorized disclosure of Shepherd's health information to his ex-wife, which was facilitated by Costco, violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of sensitive health information without explicit authorization or legitimate purpose goes against the fundamental principles of patient privacy protection mandated by HIPAA.

Therefore, based on the assessment, the case does not comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
