### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs Checked:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule

2. **Determination:**
   - The action taken by Sherri Smith in modifying the medical authorization form to restrict the disclosure strictly to "medical records and bills" and excluding private interviews with healthcare providers, except Dr. Collins, aligns with the principles of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 

3. **Compliance Assessment:**
   - Permit

Sherri's modification of the form demonstrates a clear effort to protect her daughter's privacy while still allowing necessary information to be shared for the lawsuit. By specifying the scope of disclosure and setting boundaries against broader sharing, she has shown compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's emphasis on safeguarding patient privacy and controlling the flow of sensitive information.
