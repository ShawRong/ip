### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs**: 
   - **HIPAA Privacy Rule** (HIPAA)

2. **Compliance Assessment**:
   - The case involves a legal tussle between healthcare entities regarding the disclosure of patient information.
   - The request for detailed patient data by Northwest from WRMC raises concerns about patient privacy.
   - Despite the legal complexities, the court directed WRMC to provide information with patient names replaced by generic numbers to maintain anonymity.
   
3. **Compliance Verdict**: 
   - **Forbid** (Initially, the request posed significant privacy concerns, but with the modification ensuring anonymity, it became permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule).

Based on the information presented, the case, after the modification ordered by the court, is in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule as it balances the need for information in litigation with the protection of patient privacy.
