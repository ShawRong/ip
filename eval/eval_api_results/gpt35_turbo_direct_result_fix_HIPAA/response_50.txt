Based on the provided case involving Wyeth's legal battle concerning Pondimin® and Redux™, the request to assess compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be addressed through the following steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content.
The HIPAA regulation IDs are as follows:
- Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 160 and 164

### Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case.
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without patient authorization in certain situations. One of these situations is for litigation purposes, where the disclosure is limited to the minimum necessary information for the legal proceeding.
- In the case of Wyeth seeking to conduct ex parte interviews with the plaintiffs' treating physicians, the disclosure of PHI for defense strategy purposes may be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule if certain safeguards are in place to protect patient privacy.

### Step 3: Please use Permit or Forbid to answer.
- **Permit**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule may permit Wyeth's attorneys to conduct ex parte interviews with the plaintiffs' treating physicians for the defense strategy, given that appropriate safeguards are implemented to ensure the minimum necessary disclosure of PHI for litigation purposes.

In conclusion, based on the analysis of the case and the HIPAA Privacy Rule provisions, the action of conducting ex parte interviews, while sensitive due to the nature of the information being sought, could potentially be permitted under HIPAA regulations with the necessary precautions.
