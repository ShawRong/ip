Based on the provided case involving the disclosure of Y.P.'s medical records from the Red Lake Children Services to the FBI without explicit consent, we need to assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule primarily pertains to the protection of individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
   - It defines who can access a patient's medical information and under what circumstances.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, the disclosure of Y.P.'s medical records to the FBI without explicit consent raises concerns about HIPAA compliance.
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires patient consent before sharing medical information, with certain exceptions related to law enforcement and public health activities.

3. **Answer: Forbid**
   - Given that the Red Lake Children Services shared Y.P.'s medical records with the FBI without explicit consent from the parent or family members, this action likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - While the situation involves serious allegations of child abuse and the need for cooperation between agencies, the sharing of medical information without proper authorization raises significant privacy and compliance issues under HIPAA.

In conclusion, based on the steps outlined and the details provided in the case, the sharing of Y.P.'s medical records without explicit consent likely does not comply with theh the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and the action would be considered forbidden under HIPAA regulations.
