Based on the provided case involving Virginia Downs and the unauthorized access to her medical records by the District Attorney's Office for the purpose of a criminal case against her, let's assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

#### Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content.
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164) governs the use and disclosure of individuals' health information.

#### Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case.
- In this case, the unauthorized access to Virginia's medical records without her consent raises significant concerns about compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

#### Step 3: Please use Permit or Forbid to answer.
- **Forbid**: The actions taken by the District Attorney's Office in accessing Virginia's medical records without proper authorization or consent likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which requires patient consent or a valid legal basis for disclosing protected health information.

This assessment suggests that the actions of the District Attorney's Office in obtaining Virginia's medical records without appropriate authorization or legal backing likely go against the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
