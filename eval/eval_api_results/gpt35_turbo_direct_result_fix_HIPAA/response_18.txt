**Answer:** Permit

In this case, the court allowed the disclosure of the roommate's information under a strict "qualified protective order" for the purpose of the ongoing malpractice litigation. This decision was made to balance the legal necessity of gathering evidence for the case with the privacy protections outlined under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The "qualified protective order" ensured that the information would be used solely for the litigation and would be handled in a manner that respected privacy rights.
