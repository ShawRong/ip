### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   - The relevant HIPAA regulation ID for this case is the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164). This rule sets national standards for the protection of certain health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of protected health information under specific circumstances, such as court orders or protective orders. In this case, the court granted the defendant's request for ex parte interviews subject to a protective order that carefully controls the disclosure of information relevant to the lawsuit. This approach aligns with the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Answer: Permit**
   - In this scenario, the court's decision to allow the defendant to conduct ex parte interviews with the plaintiff's treating medical providers under a protective order that safeguards the privacy rights of the plaintiff while enabling the gathering of necessary evidence is compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
