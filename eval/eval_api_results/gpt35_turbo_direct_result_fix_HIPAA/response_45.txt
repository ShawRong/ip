Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule: 45 CFR Part 160 and 45 CFR Part 164

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - **Answer:** Forbid

Explanation:
- In this case, the disclosure of Abeyta's treatment records without his explicit consent raises significant concerns regarding the protection of his private health information.
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires explicit authorization from the patient before disclosing their health information, especially in situations like this where the disclosure was made for legal defense purposes without Abeyta's consent.
- The judge's decision to deny the motion for a protective order implies a potential violation of Abeyta's privacy rights under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as the joint counseling arrangement and informed consent did not explicitly waive Abeyta's privilege for such disclosures.

Therefore, based on the steps outlined, the assessment concludes that the case is **Forbid** in terms of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
