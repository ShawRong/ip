### Response:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule primarily applies to protected health information (PHI) maintained by covered entities and business associates. It sets standards for the use and disclosure of PHI.
  
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The case involving Deborah Bray providing medical authorization for Dr. Khuri to access Nigel's medical records raises concerns regarding HIPAA compliance.
  
3. **Answer: Forbid**
   - Given the sensitive nature of the medical records and the contested compliance of the authorization, it appears that the actions taken may not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule standards. 

It is crucial to ensure that patient privacy rights are respected when disclosing medical records, especially in legal proceedings. Further assessment and potential corrective actions may be necessary to address any HIPAA compliance issues in this case.
