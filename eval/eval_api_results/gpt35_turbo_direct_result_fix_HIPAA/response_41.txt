Based on the provided information, let's assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164) establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It sets limits and conditions on the use and disclosure of such information without patient authorization.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:** In the case described, the legal dispute involves the disclosure of sensitive medical and personal information (medical records, employment records, etc.) of John Kris Morris. The defendant's legal counsel issued subpoenas to various non-party entities to collect evidence for defense. However, HIPAA regulations strictly control the disclosure of such information.

3. **Response:** The actions taken in this case raise concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of Morris's medical records and other sensitive information through subpoenas may not align with HIPAA regulations unless proper authorizations or legal procedures are followed. Therefore, without explicit patient authorization or compliance with legal requirements under HIPAA, the disclosure of such information might be considered a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Hence, the use of subpoenas to collect this information may be considered forbidden under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
