### Response:
  
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Their Content:**
   - **HIPAA Privacy Rule:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found at 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
  
2. **Determination:**  
   The case of Glen Murphy in Florida, where he is required to provide a written authorization permitting the release of his protected health information to healthcare providers involved in his care, raises concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Assessment:**  
   - **Permit** the release of protected health information to Dr. Adolfo C. Dulay and other healthcare providers involved in Murphy's care, as mandated by Florida law, appears to be in conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
  
This situation presents a complex intersection between state law requirements and federal privacy standards. While the state's statute demands disclosure of health information as a condition for proceeding with litigation, the mandatory nature of this requirement potentially contradicts the patient privacy protections outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Further analysis would be needed to determine the extent of non-compliance and potential implications for patient privacy rights under HIPAA regulations.
