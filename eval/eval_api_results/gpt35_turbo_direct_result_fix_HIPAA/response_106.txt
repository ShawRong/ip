### Response:
**Step 1:**
The HIPAA regulation IDs relevant to this case include the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 160 and 164), particularly focusing on the provisions related to the release of protected health information (PHI) and the requirements for valid authorizations.

**Step 2:**
After reviewing the case, it is evident that the HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the release of Freeman's medical records in this scenario due to the lack of a valid authorization form. The form submitted by the law firm on behalf of Freeman's family did not meet the necessary legal requirements, such as lacking a valid power of attorney, which is essential for the lawful disclosure of sensitive medical information.

**Step 3:**
The appropriate response based on the HIPAA Privacy Rule is to **Forbid** the release of Freeman's medical records in this instance until a valid authorization form with the necessary legal documentation is provided.
