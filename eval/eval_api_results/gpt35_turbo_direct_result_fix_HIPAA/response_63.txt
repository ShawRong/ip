### Response:
1. **Assessment of Compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - **Step 1:** Checking the HIPAA regulation IDs and their content reveals that the case involves the exchange of sensitive medical records for litigation purposes.
   - **Step 2:** Based on the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the scenario permits the law firm's actions under certain conditions.
   - **Step 3:** The case is **Permitted** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

In this case, the law firm's approach aligns with HIPAA regulations as it obtained proper authorization, paid reasonable costs for the service of copying medical records, and strictly maintained confidentiality. The use of medical records exclusively for litigation purposes, with consent and confidentiality protocols in place, demonstrates compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
