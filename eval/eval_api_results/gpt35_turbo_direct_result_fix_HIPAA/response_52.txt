### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule, which can be found in 45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The disclosure of James A1 White's sensitive health information by Drexel Jordan to the court raises complex ethical and legal considerations. While the HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires patient consent for the disclosure of protected health information, there are exceptions that permit disclosures without consent in certain situations, such as for treatment, payment, healthcare operations, public health activities, and in response to legal proceedings.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer: Permit**
   - In this case, considering the legal necessity and the requirement of evidence for a serious legal matter, it is likely that the disclosure of James A1 White's HIV status by Drexel Jordan to the court may be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The situation appears to fall within the exceptions that allow disclosure without patient consent for legal proceedings where the information is deemed crucial for the adjudication of charges and the pursuit of justice.
