Based on the provided case involving Lesha Carter and her minor child Jazyhia Carter, it is evident that the authorization forms sent by the Carters were not compliant with the detailed requirements outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for a valid authorization.

### Assessment:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content**: The case involves issues related to the authorization forms lacking essential elements required by HIPAA, such as specific information description, authorized entities, and purpose of disclosure.
2. **Permit or Forbid**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the providers from accessing the plaintiffs' medical records based on the non-compliant authorization forms.

In conclusion, the case does not comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the inadequacy of the authorization forms, thereby forbidding the healthcare providers from accessing Lesha and Jazyhia's medical records.
