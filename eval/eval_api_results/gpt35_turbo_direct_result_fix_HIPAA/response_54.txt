### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content Check:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule primarily deals with protected health information (PHI) and its disclosure.
   - It sets guidelines on who can access PHI, under what circumstances, and for what purposes.

2. **Determination on Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - The university's subpoena for Dr. Mezu's medical records raises concerns about the disclosure of her protected health information.
   - Given that the court found the records relevant to the lawsuit, the disclosure might be permissible under certain conditions outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Assessment Result: Permit**
   - In this case, the court's decision to allow the disclosure of Dr. Mezu's medical records aligns with the provisions within the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - The implementation of a Confidentiality Order further demonstrates efforts to protect Dr. Mezu's privacy while ensuring the lawsuit's integrity.

By issuing the Confidentiality Order and limiting access to the medical records, the court appears to have taken steps to balance the necessity of the records in the lawsuit with Dr. Mezu's right to privacy, which is a crucial aspect of HIPAA compliance.
