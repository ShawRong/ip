Based on the provided information, let's assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule is designed to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It sets limits and conditions on the use and disclosure of such information without patient authorization.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:** In this scenario, the court authorized informal ex parte communications between healthcare providers and legal representatives of the defendants without Bobbie Jean's consent. This action raises concerns about patient privacy rights and the protections usually afforded by health privacy regulations.

3. **Answer using Permit or Forbid:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires patient authorization for the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) for purposes not directly related to treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. In this case, the ex parte communications authorized by the court without Bobbie Jean's consent may conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which typically forbids such disclosures without patient authorization.

Therefore, the action of permitting informal ex parte communications without patient consent may likely be in violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
