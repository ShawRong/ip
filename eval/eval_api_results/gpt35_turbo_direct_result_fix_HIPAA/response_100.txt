### Response:
Based on the provided case scenario, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (HIPAA) and their content**: The case involves medical providers operating under the Maine Medical Marijuana Act (MMMA) as authorized caregivers, potentially facing the disclosure of protected health information to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) without explicit patient consent.
  
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**: In this situation, the disclosure of protected health information to DHHS without explicit patient consent for regulatory oversight purposes like audits, investigations, and inspections could potentially conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which generally requires patient authorization for the disclosure of protected health information.

3. **Answer (Permit or Forbid)**: Considering the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the disclosure of protected health information about qualifying patients to DHHS without explicit patient consent may **Forbid** the case, as it raises concerns regarding patient privacy protections under HIPAA regulations.

Based on the information provided, it appears that Olsen and Shaw's dilemma regarding the disclosure of patient information under the MMMA's enforcement rules without explicit patient consent does pose a potential compliance issue with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
