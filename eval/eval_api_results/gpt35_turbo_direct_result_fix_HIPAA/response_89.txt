3. **Compliance Assessment**:
   - **Answer**: Permit or Forbid
   - Based on the information provided, it seems that the government's request for the patients' medical records for the trial may be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, given that specific provisions allow for disclosure for judicial and administrative proceedings under certain conditions.
