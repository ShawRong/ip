The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of medical records in legal proceedings, provided that certain conditions are met. In this case, Eli Lilly's request for access to the medical records of Medicaid patients prescribed Zyprexa falls under the exceptions outlined in sections 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.512(e)(1) and 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.514(b)(2). These regulations allow for the release of medical information for litigation purposes if the information is relevant to the case and appropriate safeguards, such as de-identification, are implemented.

However, the states' resistance to Lilly's demands highlights the tension between protecting patient privacy and complying with legal requirements. While HIPAA allows for the disclosure of medical records in this context, the states could argue that the records are protected under physician-patient privilege and that they are not relevant to the case. Therefore, while HIPAA does permit such disclosures under specific circumstances, the states' position reflects legitimate concerns about the sensitivity and relevance of the information being requested. 

In summary, HIPAA permits the disclosure of medical records for litigation, but the states may still refuse based on privacy concerns and relevance to the case.
