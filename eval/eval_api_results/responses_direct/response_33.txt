The case described raises significant concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Under HIPAA, protected health information (PHI) can only be disclosed without patient consent in specific circumstances, such as for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, and in certain cases involving health oversight activities.

In this scenario, while the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) claims to be acting as a health oversight agency, the key issue lies in the lack of knowledge and consent from the employees whose medical information is being accessed. HIPAA requires that individuals be informed about the use and disclosure of their health information, and it typically does not allow for such disclosures without consent unless they fall within specific exceptions.

The actions of the OIG agents, contacting healthcare providers directly and accessing medical records without the employees' consent or knowledge, likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The employees' right to privacy and control over their health information is fundamental under HIPAA, and the justification provided by the OIG may not sufficiently align with the legal standards for permissible disclosures.

Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids this practice as it undermines the privacy rights of the USPS employees. Legal action taken by the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) and the American Postal Workers Union (APWU) to challenge this policy could be supported by the provisions of HIPAA that protect individuals' health information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
