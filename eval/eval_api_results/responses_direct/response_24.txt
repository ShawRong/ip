The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without patient consent in certain circumstances, including when there is a court order. In the scenario involving Michael J. McGill, the prosecutor obtained a court order compelling Reynolds Memorial Hospital to release McGill's health records. This court order is a legal directive that allows the hospital to disclose the information despite the usual privacy protections under HIPAA.

Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the actions taken in this case due to the existence of the court order, which bypasses the standard consent requirements for the release of medical records. This aligns with the provisions of HIPAA that allow for disclosures necessary for judicial proceedings.
