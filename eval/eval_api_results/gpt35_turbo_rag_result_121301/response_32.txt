Based on the provided case involving Dorothy Shanks, her prosthetist James Shrader, and her former employer Sony, we will assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(g)(5)) and their content**:
   - HIPAA regulation 164.502(g)(5) pertains to permitted uses and disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings. This includes disclosures in response to court orders and subpoenas, as well as other legal processes.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**:
   - Considering the scenario described, where Dorothy Shanks consented to the disclosure of her medical information by signing a release authorizing access to her medical records, it appears that the exchange of sensitive medical information was conducted in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
  
3. **Answer**: Permit

In this case, the sharing of private medical information about Dorothy Shanks seems to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule as her explicit consent was obtained, which is a crucial factor in ensuring compliance with legal standards regarding the disclosure of personal health information in legal proceedings.
