Based on the information provided in the case of Antoinne D. Thomas, where healthcare providers were approached to provide sensitive health information for the purpose of a legal case involving a personal injury claim, we can assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.512(b)(1)(v)(A)(2)) and their content.

HIPAA regulation 164.512(b)(1)(v)(A)(2) pertains to the disclosure of protected health information for judicial and administrative proceedings.

### Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case.

In this scenario, the disclosure of Antoinne D. Thomas's health information to the legal representatives of the defendants seems to align with the requirements of the legal process initiated by the lawsuit. The purpose is to provide evidence relevant to the claims of personal injury, which could be considered within the scope of permitted disclosures under the HIPAA Privacy Rule for judicial proceedings.

### Step 3: Please use Permit or Forbid to answer.

**Response: Permit**

Given the context provided, the disclosure of Antoinne D. Thomas's health information to aid in the legal proceedings appears to be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as it aligns with the requirements of the judicial process initiated by the lawsuit.
