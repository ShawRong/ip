Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule using the steps outlined:

1. **Step 1 - Check the HIPAA regulation IDs and their content:**
   - In this scenario, the key HIPAA regulation relevant is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, which safeguards the privacy of individuals' medical records and personal health information.
   
2. **Step 2 - Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The request made by the plaintiff to access the medical files of the train crew members for the wrongful death lawsuit raises concerns about the privacy of the employees' medical information.
   - Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, there are strict guidelines and protections in place regarding the disclosure of individuals' medical information.
   - Union Pacific's objection to the request based on concerns over violating HIPAA and other medical privacy laws indicates a recognition of the importance of protecting the privacy of the employees' health information.
   - Given the sensitive nature of medical records and the need to balance legal discovery with privacy rights, it is likely that the HIPAA Privacy Rule would restrict the disclosure of these medical files without appropriate consent or legal justification.

3. **Step 3 - Answer: Forbid**
   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the case, it would be appropriate to conclude that the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely forbid the disclosure of the medical files of the train crew members in this scenario without proper authorization or legal basis.
