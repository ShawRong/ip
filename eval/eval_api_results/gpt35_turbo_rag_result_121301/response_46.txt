Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the steps outlined:

1. **Checking HIPAA regulation IDs and their content**:
   - We need to identify the specific HIPAA regulation IDs that are relevant to this case and review their content to understand the rules and requirements they impose on the handling of protected health information (PHI).

2. **Determining whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**:
   - After reviewing the relevant HIPAA regulations and considering the details of the case involving the sharing of private medical information in a legal context, we need to determine if the actions taken comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
  
3. **Answering with Permit or Forbid**:
   - Based on our assessment, we will conclude whether the case is permitted or forbidden under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

This process involves a detailed examination of the specific HIPAA regulations implicated by the scenario described and an evaluation of whether the sharing of protected health information in the legal proceedings aligns with the requirements outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
