Based on the provided case, let's assess its compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the specified steps:

### Step 1:
The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs to consider are:
- 164.501 “Health care operations” (6)(v)
- 164.506(c)(1)
- 164.103 Required by law

### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it appears that the key issue revolves around the disclosure of patient information in response to a legal subpoena. The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally permits the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without patient authorization in response to a valid subpoena, as long as certain conditions are met.

### Step 3:
In this case, the disclosure of patient information by WRMC in response to the subpoena seems to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements, as it was done under a protective order and with patient names replaced with generic numbers to maintain anonymity. Therefore, the action taken by WRMC can be considered as **Permit** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
