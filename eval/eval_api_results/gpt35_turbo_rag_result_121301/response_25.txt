Based on the provided case, here is the assessment of whether the actions described comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content Check**:
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule
   - Relevant sections: 45 CFR 160 & 164

2. **Determination**:
   - The actions of Dr. Reinholds and Stewart Mortensen, as described in the case, **violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule**.
   
3. **Compliance Assessment**:
   - **Forbid**

Explanation:
- The disclosure of extensive personal and medical information to consumer reporting agencies without the patient's authorization violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which mandates the protection of patients' medical information from unauthorized disclosures.
- By sharing sensitive details such as names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and medical history without consent, Dr. Reinholds and Mortensen breached the patient's privacy rights under HIPAA.
- This unauthorized disclosure not only disregarded patient consent but also compromised the confidentiality expected in the patient-doctor relationship, exposing the patients to potential privacy and financial risks.

Thus, the actions taken in this case are not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and are in violation of patient privacy rights.
