2. **Determination:** Permit

Based on the information provided in the case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of the requested records by OLRS. The situation involves concerns of abuse and neglect of a minor under the care of The Buckeye Ranch, and OLRS, as a protection and advocacy agency, has a legitimate interest in accessing these records to ensure the child's rights are protected. The disclosure falls under the exceptions outlined in the HIPAA regulations for health oversight activities and situations where disclosure is required by law.

Therefore, in this case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of the records requested by OLRS for the purpose of investigating potential abuse and neglect, as it aligns with the exceptions provided within the HIPAA regulations.
