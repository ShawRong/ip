Based on the provided case involving Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the government's subpoena for medical records related to late-term abortions, we need to assess the situation for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
#### Step 1:
- HIPAA regulation IDs: {45 CFR Part 160, 45 CFR Part 164}

#### Step 2:
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of medical records for judicial and administrative proceedings under certain conditions. However, it also emphasizes the importance of protecting patient confidentiality.

#### Step 3:
- **Response: Permit**

Given the legal basis for the government's request and the provisions within the HIPAA Privacy Rule regarding disclosures for judicial proceedings, in this case, the disclosure of the medical records for the trial challenging the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 would likely be permitted under HIPAA regulations, provided that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the confidentiality of the information outside the litigation context.
