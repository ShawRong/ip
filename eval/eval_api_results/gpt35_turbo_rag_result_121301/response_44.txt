      - Given the scenario described in the case, where St. Elizabethâ€™s Hospital disclosed Kim's mental health records without her consent or a court order, it is a clear violation of HIPAA regulations. The unauthorized sharing of sensitive mental health information without proper consent or legal basis goes against the fundamental principles of patient confidentiality outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This breach raises significant concerns regarding privacy rights and the safeguarding of patient information within both legal and healthcare settings.
