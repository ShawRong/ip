### Response:
1. **Regulation ID Check:**
   - HIPAA Regulation ID: 164.504(f)(2)(iii)(A)
   - Content: This regulation pertains to the requirements for Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, outlining the obligations and responsibilities of covered entities and their business associates in safeguarding protected health information (PHI).

2. **Permit or Forbid Assessment:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the unauthorized disclosure of protected health information (PHI) to third parties. In this case, the unauthorized disclosure of the Privileged Supplement containing individual medical claims and records, which constituted PHI, to third parties violated HIPAA regulations.

Therefore, the sharing of the Privileged Supplement's contents with third parties without authorization was not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
