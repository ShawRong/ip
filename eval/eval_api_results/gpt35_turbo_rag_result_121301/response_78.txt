### Response:

**Step 1:** Checking the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.510(a)(3)(i), 164.510(a)(3)(i)(B)), we find that these regulations pertain to the circumstances under which a covered entity may use or disclose protected health information (PHI) without authorization.

**Step 2:** Considering the case described, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of PHI without patient authorization in certain situations, including for law enforcement purposes as outlined in 164.512(f).

**Step 3:** The actions taken in this case, such as conducting blood alcohol tests without explicit consent, sharing the results with law enforcement, and releasing medical records under a subpoena for a criminal investigation, are permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule for law enforcement purposes.

Therefore, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule in this case would be: **Permit**.
