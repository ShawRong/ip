### Response:

### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs relevant to this case are:
- 164.510(a)(3): Uses and disclosures requiring an opportunity to agree or object
- 164.502(a)(4)(i): Permitted uses and disclosures: Minimum necessary

### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it is crucial to determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the disclosure of Kirsch's blood-alcohol test results to law enforcement.

### Step 3:
The disclosure of Kirsch's blood-alcohol test results to law enforcement in this case would likely be considered **forbidden** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This is because the information was disclosed without Kirsch's explicit consent and without a direct request from law enforcement, which raises concerns about the violation of patient privacy rights. The fact that the disclosure was made under the belief that it was necessary for the ongoing investigation does not necessarily justify the breach of confidentiality under HIPAA regulations.
