Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.504(e)(4)(ii)(B)) and their content:**
   - HIPAA regulation 164.504(e)(4)(ii)(B) pertains to the Business Associate Contracts or Arrangements. It outlines the specific requirements that must be included in contracts between covered entities and business associates to ensure the protection of individuals' protected health information.

2. **Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, the EMS (Philadelphia Fire Department Emergency Medical Services) shared sensitive health information with third-party billing companies without appropriate safeguards in place. The mishandling of this information by an employee of one of these companies led to data breaches and subsequent fraudulent activities.
   - The actions of the Defendants in mishandling and sharing protected health information without proper safeguards clearly violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Step 3: Answer - Forbid:**
   - The actions described in the case clearly go against the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which mandates the protection and confidential handling of individuals' sensitive health information. The unauthorized access, sharing, and subsequent misuse of this information by the Defendants are in direct violation of HIPAA regulations.

Therefore, based on the assessment, the case is in violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and should be addressed accordingly to ensure accountability and prevent such breaches in the future.
