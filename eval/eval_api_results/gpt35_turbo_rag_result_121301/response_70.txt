### Response:
1. **Checking HIPAA regulation IDs and their content:**
   - **164.501 “Health care operations” (6)(v):** Pertains to the use or disclosure of protected health information for health care operations.
   - **164.103 Required by law:** Covers the situations where disclosure of protected health information is required by law.
   - **164.502(j)(1)(ii):** Focuses on the minimum necessary standard for using protected health information.

2. **Determining whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The case involves the disclosure of operative notes for a medical malpractice lawsuit.
   - The court's decision to order the production of redacted documents aligns with HIPAA regulation 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(a), which permits disclosures in judicial settings under certain conditions.
   - Considering the legal protocols and the critical role of the requested information in the ongoing litigation, it can be argued that the disclosure, when appropriately redacted, falls within the permissible boundaries set by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Conclusion: Permit**
   - In this case, the disclosure of redacted operative notes aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule under the circumstances outlined in the court's decision. It balances the need for information in legal proceedings with the imperative to protect patient privacy, demonstrating compliance with the relevant regulations.
