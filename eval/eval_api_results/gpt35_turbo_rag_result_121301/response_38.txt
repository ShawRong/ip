Based on the provided case and the steps outlined for assessing compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

Step 1: 
The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs mentioned are 164.501 "Health care operations" (6)(v) and 164.502(a)(1)(ii). Upon examining these regulations, it is crucial to understand the content they entail, especially regarding health care operations and permitted uses and disclosures.

Step 2:
In this case, considering the actions taken by Laura Mais on behalf of her husband Mark, it appears that the hospital and associated entities processed Mark's health information for billing and collection purposes as per the Notice of Privacy Practices. The disclosure of this information to Florida United Radiology, McKesson Practice Services, and Gulf Coast Collection Bureau, Inc. aligns with the permitted uses under the HIPAA Privacy Rule for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.

Step 3:
Given the information provided, the actions taken in this case seem to align with the permissions granted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Therefore, the assessment would likely conclude that the case is **Permit** in terms of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

It is essential to note that a comprehensive assessment should involve a detailed review of all relevant information and the specific provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule to make a final determination on compliance.
