### Response:
#### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs relevant to this case are:
- 164.501 “Health care operations” (6)(v)
- 164.506(c)(1)

#### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it is evident that the disclosure of Virginia Downs' medical records to the District Attorney's Office without her consent and without the necessary legal backing raises significant concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 

#### Step 3:
**Answer: Forbid**

This action appears to violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which generally requires patient consent or a valid legal process for the disclosure of protected health information. In this case, the absence of Virginia's consent and the lack of proper legal authorization suggest that the disclosure was not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
