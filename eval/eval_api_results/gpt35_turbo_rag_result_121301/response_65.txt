### Response:
#### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs mentioned in the case are 164.502(g)(5)(ii) and 164.501 (Psychotherapy notes). These regulations pertain to the disclosure of protected health information and the privacy of psychotherapy notes respectively. 

#### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it is evident that the actions taken by Ross Cashen's legal team, specifically obtaining Jane Doe's mental health records without her consent, raise significant legal and ethical concerns. The disclosure of such private health information without proper authorization potentially violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

#### Step 3:
In this scenario, the actions taken by Cashen's legal team to obtain Jane Doe's mental health records without her consent would likely be considered as **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This is because accessing a person's mental health records without proper authorization violates the individual's privacy rights and goes against the core principles of HIPAA regulations.
