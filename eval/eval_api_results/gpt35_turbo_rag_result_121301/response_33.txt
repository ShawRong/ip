### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.504(f)(2)(ii)(B)) and their content:**
   - **164.504(f)(2)(ii)(B)** - This section pertains to the uses and disclosures for which an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is not required. It includes instances where the covered entity is required by law to disclose protected health information without the individualâ€™s authorization.

2. **Determination:**
   - The case described involving the United States Postal Service (USPS) and its Office of Inspector General (OIG) raises significant concerns regarding the handling of protected health information without the knowledge or consent of the USPS employees, who are the patients in this scenario.

3. **Compliance Assessment:**
   - **Answer:** Forbid
   - **Reasoning:** The actions of the OIG agents in accessing the medical information of USPS employees without their knowledge or consent likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires covered entities to obtain individual authorization before disclosing protected health information, with some limited exceptions. In this case, the OIG agents' practice of accessing medical records without consent appears to be in violation of HIPAA regulations, which aim to protect the privacy and security of individuals' health information.

In conclusion, the described practice of the OIG agents seems to be non-compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as it involves accessing protected health information without proper authorization from the individuals involved.
