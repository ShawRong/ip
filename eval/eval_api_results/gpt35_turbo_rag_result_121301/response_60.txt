2. **Determination:** Based on the information provided, the case involving Dr. Frank Castro's legal representatives engaging in ex parte interviews with the treating physicians of Stacey Caldwell raises concerns under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The approach of obtaining Caldwell's health information without her explicit consent may potentially violate the patient's privacy rights as outlined in the HIPAA regulations.
