   The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires patient authorization for the disclosure of protected health information, especially in situations involving legal proceedings. In this case, the repeated requests by Denali for ex parte communications without Harrold-Jones's consent go against the principles of patient privacy and consent outlined in the HIPAA regulations. Harrold-Jones's refusal to grant such authorizations aligns with her rights under HIPAA to control the disclosure of her medical information.
