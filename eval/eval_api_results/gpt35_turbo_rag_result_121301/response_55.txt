Based on the provided case involving Christopher J. Bauer's blood-alcohol test results being disclosed to the State's Attorney and the grand jury without his explicit consent, we need to assess the compliance of this situation with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
1. **Check HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.502(a)(4)(i)):**
   - HIPAA regulation 164.502(a)(4)(i) pertains to the Permitted Uses and Disclosures: Disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings. In this case, the disclosure was made in response to a subpoena from the grand jury for the purpose of legal proceedings.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of protected health information without patient authorization in response to a valid subpoena, court order, or other legal process. However, certain conditions and safeguards need to be met for such disclosures to be compliant with HIPAA.

3. **Answer: Permit**
   - Based on the information provided and the nature of the disclosure to the grand jury in response to a subpoena related to legal proceedings, the disclosure of Bauer's blood-alcohol test results without his explicit consent appears to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's provisions for disclosures in judicial proceedings.

This assessment indicates that the disclosure in this case may be considered permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
