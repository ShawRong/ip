### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs:** The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs are 160.538(c)(3) and 160.538(d).
   
2. **Permit or Forbid:** After reviewing the case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would **Forbid** the disclosure of the health records of the witnesses without individual consent or a court order. This is in line with the stringent requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule which prioritize the protection of individuals' health information and privacy rights.

This determination is based on the fact that the defense's request to access these records without the explicit consent of the witnesses or a clear court mandate goes against the privacy protections outlined in the HIPAA regulations. The need to balance transparency in legal proceedings with the protection of sensitive health information is crucial, and in this case, the disclosure of the witnesses' health records would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
