The court's directives to limit the scope of the evaluation and later seal the records demonstrate an attempt to balance the need for information with the protection of A.S.'s privacy rights. The handling of sensitive information was done in accordance with the regulations, ensuring that the flow of private data, specifically A.S.'s mental health evaluation, was managed appropriately within the legal and health service provider frameworks.
