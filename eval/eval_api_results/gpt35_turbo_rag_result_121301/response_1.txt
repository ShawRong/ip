Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

### Step 1:
- **HIPAA regulation IDs**: 164.512(a)(2), 164.502(b)
- **Content**: These regulations pertain to the disclosure of protected health information for law enforcement purposes and the permissible uses and disclosures of protected health information.

### Step 2:
- **Determination**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of protected health information to law enforcement in certain circumstances, such as with a valid subpoena.

### Step 3:
- **Answer**: Permit

In this case, the subpoena demanding the release of Diana Zamora's medical records from the medical center for the ongoing criminal investigation aligns with the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, specifically allowing disclosures to law enforcement under certain conditions, making it a permissible request.
