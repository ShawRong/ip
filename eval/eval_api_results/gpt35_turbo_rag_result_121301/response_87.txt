### Response:
Step 1: The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs to consider in this case are 164.508(a)(2)(i)(A), which pertain to the permissible uses and disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings.

Step 2: After reviewing the case, it is evident that the actions taken by Defendantâ€™s attorneys, contacting Dr. Harris without Crenshaw's consent to obtain medical information for the defense's case, may potentially violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This is because the disclosure of protected health information without explicit authorization from the patient generally goes against the core principles of patient privacy under HIPAA.

Step 3: **Forbid** - The scenario described in the case, where medical information was sought from Dr. Harris without Crenshaw's consent, likely does not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule regulations. This unauthorized disclosure raises legal and ethical concerns regarding patient confidentiality and privacy rights.
