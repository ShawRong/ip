Based on the provided case involving Nigel Bray, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be conducted through the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.508(b)(5)(i)) and their content**:
   - HIPAA regulation 164.508(b)(5)(i) pertains to the requirements for a valid authorization for the disclosure of protected health information (PHI). This includes specifying the information authorized for disclosure, the purpose of the disclosure, expiration date or event, and the individual's right to revoke the authorization.
  
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**:
   - In this case, the situation involves Deborah Bray providing Dr. Khuri with a medical authorization to access Nigel's complete medical records. From a HIPAA perspective, the authorization should comply with all the required elements to be considered valid.
  
3. **Answer: Permit or Forbid**:
   - **Permit**: If Deborah's medical authorization meets all the necessary HIPAA requirements and safeguards, allowing Dr. Khuri access to Nigel's medical records would likely be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
  
In conclusion, if the medical authorization provided by Deborah Bray adheres to the stipulated HIPAA regulations, it would likely be permissible for Dr. Khuri to access Nigel's medical records for the purposes outlined in the case.
