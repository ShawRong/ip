Based on the provided case, let's assess it for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

#### Step 1:
- **HIPAA Regulation IDs:** 
  - 164.508(b)(4)(ii)(B): This section pertains to the rights of individuals and how they can exercise those rights.
  - 164.501 Psychotherapy notes: This section specifically addresses the protection of psychotherapy notes.
  - 164.508(a)(2)(i)(A): This section talks about the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information.

#### Step 2:
- **Determination:** 
  - The disclosure of Abeyta's treatment records without his explicit consent seems to conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. While joint counseling may imply shared information between the parties involved, the disclosure to a third party without explicit consent raises concerns.

#### Step 3:
- **Conclusion:** 
  - **Forbid**: Based on the information provided, the disclosure of Abeyta's treatment records without his explicit consent likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which generally requires explicit patient consent for disclosing protected health information to third parties.

This assessment suggests that the disclosure in the described legal situation likely goes against the requirements outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
