Based on the provided case involving Elwyn, Inc. and D.M., a former student, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be conducted as follows:

#### Step 1:
- HIPAA regulation IDs and their content should be checked to determine the applicability of the HIPAA Privacy Rule in this scenario.

#### Step 2:
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the disclosure of private information in this case based on the specific circumstances outlined in the case description.

#### Step 3:
- The determination of whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case should be made by categorizing it as either "Permit" or "Forbid" based on the regulations and guidelines provided under HIPAA.

Given the complexity of the legal battle and the sensitive nature of the information being requested, a thorough analysis of the HIPAA regulations, particularly 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.512(e), is crucial to determine whether the disclosures demanded by D.M. are permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Additionally, considering the need to balance disclosure requirements in legal proceedings with the protection of individual privacy rights, a nuanced evaluation of the case in light of HIPAA regulations is warranted.
