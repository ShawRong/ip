2. **Determination of Compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - The case involving Randolph Koch and his authorization for the release of medical information raises questions about compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - Based on the information provided, Koch had initially authorized the release of his psychotherapy records and communications to the SEC. However, he later revoked this authorization before any information was disclosed by Ms. Aron.
   - The question of whether Koch's actions and the subsequent subpoena from the SEC complied with the stipulated regulations, particularly regarding the revocation of consent for the disclosure of private health information, is essential to assess compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Answer: Permit or Forbid**
   - **Answer:** In this case, considering Koch's revocation of authorization before any information was disclosed, it appears that the HIPAA Privacy Rule would **Forbid** the disclosure of the psychotherapy records and communications to the SEC, as Koch exercised his right to revoke authorization.
