### Response:
1. **Compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule**: 
   - **Regulation IDs Checked**: HIPAA regulation IDs 164.512(b)(1)(v)(A)(2) have been reviewed to assess compliance.
   - **Content Assessment**: The case involves the disclosure of sensitive medical and personal information.
   
2. **Permit or Forbid Decision**:
   - **Determination**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in this case.
   
The scenario described involves the disclosure of extensive medical and personal information through subpoenas issued to non-party entities. Given the nature of the information being sought and the context of the legal dispute, the disclosure appears to contravene the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which strictly regulates the use and disclosure of PHI. In this situation, the disclosure of Morris's medical records, employment history, and other sensitive personal data without proper authorization or safeguards likely violates HIPAA regulations.
