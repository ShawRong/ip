### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(g)(5)(ii)) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA regulation 164.502(g)(5)(ii) pertains to the right of an individual to have access to their protected health information (PHI) with certain exceptions.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally allows individuals to access their own medical records, with a few exceptions. In this case, Merryfield's request to access his medical and treatment records falls within the scope of his rights under HIPAA.

3. **Answer: Permit**
   - In this scenario, based on the HIPAA Privacy Rule and considering Merryfield's right to access his own health information, the case should be permitted. Merryfield appears to have a legitimate reason for requesting access to his medical records, and denying him access may not align with HIPAA regulations regarding patient rights to their own health information.
