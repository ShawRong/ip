Based on the provided case involving Kelly Regian and the actions taken regarding the release of protected health information, the assessment regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be outlined as follows:

1. **Step 1 - Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.506(a)) and their content:**
   - HIPAA regulation IDs 164.506(a) pertain to the general requirements for authorizations. These regulations specify the elements required in an authorization for the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI).

2. **Step 2 - Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, considering that Kelly and her husband provided a written notice of their health care liability claim to Dr. Collins, which included an authorization form for the release of protected health information, this action aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The authorization form allowed for the disclosure of medical information within defined parameters for the purposes of investigating and evaluating the health care claim and defending against any resulting litigation. The authorization also included provisions for Kelly to revoke it in writing at any time.

3. **Step 3 - Conclusion:**
   - The actions taken by Kelly and her husband, as described in the case, fall within the permissible boundaries of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The authorization form they provided allowed for the disclosure of protected health information under specific conditions related to their health care liability claim.

### Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would **Permit** the actions taken in this case.
