  - 164.510(a): Permits disclosures for public health activities.

#### Step 2:
- **Determination: Forbid**

#### Step 3:
- **Answer: Forbid**

Explanation:
- The case involves the disclosure of the patient's private health information to law enforcement without consent. While there were concerns for public safety, the situation did not fall under the exceptions that permit such disclosures under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure was not in response to a request for information nor was it for reporting purposes. Therefore, the disclosure in this case would likely be considered a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
