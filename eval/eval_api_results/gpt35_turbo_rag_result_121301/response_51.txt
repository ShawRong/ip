#### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs and their content should be reviewed. This involves identifying the specific regulations within the HIPAA Privacy Rule that are relevant to the case.

#### Step 2:
After reviewing the case details, it is evident that the disclosure of Mubita's health information by the Health Department to the Latah County Prosecutorâ€™s Office raises concerns regarding patient confidentiality and the handling of sensitive health data. 

#### Step 3:
In this scenario, the disclosure of Mubita's health records to the prosecutor's office without his consent does not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which generally requires patient authorization for the release of protected health information. Therefore, the action taken by the Health Department in providing Mubita's health records may be considered a violation of HIPAA regulations.

### Conclusion:
