### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found in 45 CFR Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The case involving the City of Plainfield and the disclosure of detailed health plan information appears to intersect with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
  
3. **Answer: Forbid**
   - Given the sensitive nature of the health information requested, especially regarding individual claims experience and covered dependents, disclosing such details could potentially violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which aims to safeguard personal health information from unauthorized access. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the disclosure of such detailed health plan information in this case.
