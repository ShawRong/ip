Based on the provided case involving Dr. Joseph Zadeh and the DEA's subpoena for his patients' medical records, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:** The relevant sections of the HIPAA Privacy Rule in Part 164 outline the standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
   
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:** Given the sensitive nature of the information requested by the DEA and Dr. Zadeh's concerns about patient privacy, it is important to evaluate whether the disclosure of the patients' medical records complies with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer:** In this case, the disclosure of comprehensive medical information, including diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory work, and payment methods, without patient consent and with a nondisclosure provision, likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The rule generally requires patient authorization for the release of such information, except in specific circumstances outlined within the regulation for law enforcement purposes.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the disclosure of the patients' medical records as requested by the DEA, without patient consent and with a nondisclosure provision, would likely be **FORBIDDEN** by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
