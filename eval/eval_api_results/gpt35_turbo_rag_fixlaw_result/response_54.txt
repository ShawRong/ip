### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs under Part 164 of the HIPAA Privacy Rule pertain to the protection of individually identifiable health information and the permissible uses and disclosures of such information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, the disclosure of Dr. Mezu's medical records under a subpoena in a legal proceeding needs to be assessed in light of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The rule allows for disclosures in certain circumstances, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena, provided that certain safeguards are in place to protect the privacy of the individual.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer: Permit**
   - The disclosure of Dr. Mezu's medical records under a subpoena for the lawsuit over the denial of FMLA leave is permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, given that the court found the records necessary for the proceedings. The implementation of a Confidentiality Order further helps mitigate privacy concerns and ensures that access to the records is limited to relevant parties under specific conditions.
