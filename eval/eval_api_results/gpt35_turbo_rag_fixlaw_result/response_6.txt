Based on the provided case involving the ATSDR medical study and the prosecution's request for access to sensitive health information for a criminal trial, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

### Step 1:
The relevant HIPAA regulation is Part 164, which outlines the Security and Privacy Rules. Specifically, the Privacy Rule under HIPAA establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

### Step 2:
In this scenario, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of protected health information without individual authorization for certain law enforcement purposes, including for legal proceedings. However, there are strict conditions and safeguards that must be met to ensure compliance with the rule.

### Step 3:
Therefore, in this case, the disclosure of the medical records from the ATSDR study to the U.S. Prosecution Team for the criminal trial would be **Permitted** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, given that the necessary safeguards and conditions are followed to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals' health information.
