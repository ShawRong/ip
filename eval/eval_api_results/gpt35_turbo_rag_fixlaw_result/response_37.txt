### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and Content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule: 45 CFR Part 164 outlines the standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information.
   
2. **Determination:** The case of Glen Murphy in Florida raises concerns regarding the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and its alignment with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Assessment:** Based on the information provided, the requirement for Murphy to sign an authorization form allowing the release of his protected health information seems to conflict with the fundamental principles of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of PHI to the healthcare provider being accused of negligence raises significant privacy concerns for Murphy.

4. **Conclusion:** In this scenario, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely forbid the disclosure of Murphy's protected health information without his explicit consent that is not coerced by legal mandates. The case raises important questions about the balance between state legal requirements and federal privacy protections.

5. **Verdict:** **Forbid** - The HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely forbid the disclosure of Murphy's protected health information under the circumstances described in the case.
