Based on the provided case involving Dr. Roger T. Crenshaw and Dr. Harris, we can assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule using the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   The relevant sections of the HIPAA Privacy Rule (Part 164) outline the standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
   
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   Given the scenario where Dr. Harris provided medical information to Defendantâ€™s attorneys without Crenshaw's explicit consent, it appears that this action may violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule, specifically regarding the disclosure of protected health information without authorization.

3. **Answer (Permit or Forbid):**
   In this case, the action of obtaining medical information from Dr. Harris without Crenshaw's consent likely **forbids** compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of sensitive health information without proper authorization goes against the core principles of patient privacy protection mandated by HIPAA.
