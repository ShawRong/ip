Based on the provided case involving CVS pharmacies and the handling of patient prescription information, let's assess whether it complies with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content
- **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164)**:
  - **164.502**: Uses and disclosures of protected health information.
  - **164.514**: Other requirements relating to uses and disclosures of protected health information.

### Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case
- **Assessment**: The handling of patient prescription information by CVS, where de-identified data was sold to pharmaceutical companies and third-party data firms, raises concerns regarding the protection of patient health information.
  
### Step 3: Conclusion
- **Answer**: **Forbid**
  
This case potentially violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule by mishandling patient information, especially if the de-identified data could be re-identified or linked back to specific individuals. CVS's actions may not align with the privacy protections mandated by HIPAA regulations.

Further detailed analysis and investigation would be necessary to fully determine the extent of the violation and the potential consequences under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
