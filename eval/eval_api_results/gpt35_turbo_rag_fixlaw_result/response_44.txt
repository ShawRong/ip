### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content**:
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule can be found in 45 CFR Part 164. This section includes standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information, known as protected health information (PHI). It outlines who is covered by the rule, what information is protected, and the safeguards that must be in place to ensure the privacy and security of PHI.

2. **Determination of Compliance**:
   - The disclosure of Kim's mental health records by St. Elizabethâ€™s Hospital without her consent raises serious concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - The rule generally prohibits the disclosure of PHI without the patient's authorization, except in specific situations outlined in the regulation.

3. **Assessment**:
   - **Step 1:** The relevant regulations can be found in 45 CFR Part 164.
   - **Step 2:** The disclosure of Kim's mental health records without her consent likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - **Step 3:** **Forbid**. The disclosure of Kim's mental health records without her consent is likely not permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

In this case, the disclosure of Kim's mental health records without her explicit authorization appears to conflict with the fundamental principles of patient privacy and confidentiality established by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
