### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - Part 164 of the HIPAA regulations outlines the Security and Privacy Rules that govern the protection of PHI (Protected Health Information).

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally prohibits the disclosure of PHI without patient authorization, with specific exceptions such as for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.

3. **Answer: Forbid**
   - In this case, the sharing of the Appellee's medical records with law enforcement without his consent likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The grand jury subpoena, although a legal instrument, does not necessarily override the privacy protections afforded by HIPAA. The disclosure of medical records for a criminal investigation into driving while intoxicated, without the Appellee's consent, raises significant privacy concerns under HIPAA.
