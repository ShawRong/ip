### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA regulation IDs under Part164 pertain to the Security and Privacy Rules. It is essential to review these regulations to understand the specific requirements and standards set forth by HIPAA regarding the protection of individuals' health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, where the court has granted the defendant's request for ex parte interviews subject to a protective order that carefully controls the disclosure of protected health information, it appears that the disclosure aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule under specific conditions, such as court orders or protective orders, to ensure the privacy and rights of the plaintiff are safeguarded. Therefore, based on the provided information, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the actions taken in this scenario.

3. **Answer (Permit or Forbid):**
   - Permit

By conducting the ex parte interviews under the court's protective order, which limits the disclosure to relevant information necessary for the lawsuit and includes measures to prevent intimidation or undue influence, the defendant can gather the required evidence while upholding the plaintiff's privacy rights within the bounds of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
