Based on the provided case involving Randolph Koch, we can assess its compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The relevant regulation cited in the case is 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.508(b)(5)(I), which deals with authorizations for the disclosure of protected health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, it appears that Koch initially authorized the release of his psychotherapy records and communications to the SEC, following the HIPAA regulation. However, he later revoked this authorization before the information was disclosed. Despite his revocation, the district court ruled that Koch had impliedly waived the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Koch disputed this ruling, claiming that his actions did not constitute an express waiver of privilege.

3. **Answer (Permit or Forbid):**
   - Considering the facts presented, the case seems to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule regarding the authorization and revocation of disclosure of protected health information. Koch's revocation of authorization before the information was disclosed should typically be respected, as per HIPAA guidelines. Therefore, the case should be **Forbid** with regard to the disclosure of protected health information in compliance with HIPAA regulations.
