### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 164) establishes national standards for the protection of certain health information. It includes provisions related to the permitted uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI).
   
2. **Determination of Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - Based on the provided case involving The Buckeye Ranch, OLRS, and the 13-year-old child, the following assessment can be made:
   
   - **Permit or Forbid:** Permit
   
   - **Explanation:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of protected health information without individual authorization in certain circumstances. In this case, OLRS, as a designated protection and advocacy system, had legitimate reasons to access the records related to the child's wrist injury and the facility's seclusion and restraint practices. These reasons are aligned with health oversight activities and the need to investigate potential abuse or neglect, which are permissible disclosures under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   
   - OLRS's request was made to ensure the protection and advocacy of the child's rights, which is a crucial aspect of their mandate. The balancing act between individual privacy and the need to investigate and prevent abuse and neglect in vulnerable populations is a key consideration in this case.
   
   - Therefore, in this scenario, the disclosure of the specified records to OLRS would likely be permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, given the circumstances and the agency's mission to safeguard the rights of mentally ill individuals.
