Based on the provided case involving Sister Diane Depwe and the legal maneuver to subpoena medical records, we can assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule using the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - HIPAA regulation IDs under Part 164 cover the Security and Privacy Rules, which outline the standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this scenario, the case involves the disclosure of sensitive medical records in a legal dispute. The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally prohibits the disclosure of protected health information without proper authorization, except in specific situations outlined in the rule.

3. **Answer - Forbid:**
   - Given the circumstances described in the case where confidential medical records are being sought in a custody dispute without clear legal justification and the healthcare provider's concerns for patient welfare, it appears that the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely forbid the disclosure of these records without proper authorization.

In conclusion, based on the details provided, it seems that the case involving Sister Diane Depwe and the subpoena of medical records does not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and disclosing such information without proper authorization would likely be forbidden under HIPAA regulations.
