### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule can be found in 45 CFR Part 164. This rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - Considering the scenario where Marriott requested authorizations for Cohan's medical records, it is crucial to analyze whether these requests align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Answer: Permit or Forbid:**
   - The broad language in the authorizations provided by Marriott raises concerns regarding the potential violation of Cohan's privacy rights under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Cohan's refusal to sign these authorizations indicates a conflict with the rule's requirements. Therefore, in this case, it may be deemed as **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule until a mutually agreeable protective order is established that complies with the regulations to safeguard Cohan's privacy rights.
