### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule can be found in 45 CFR Part 164. This rule governs the protection of individually identifiable health information by covered entities and their business associates.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The disclosure of the patient's private health information without consent to law enforcement raises concerns under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. According to the Rule, covered entities are generally prohibited from disclosing protected health information without authorization unless it falls under specific permissible uses and disclosures.

3. **Answer - Permit or Forbid:**
   - **Forbid**: In this case, the disclosure of the patient's private health information to law enforcement without consent does not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements. It is essential to protect patient privacy and confidentiality unless there is a specific exception under the law that permits such disclosure.
