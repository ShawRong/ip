### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule is governed by regulations found in 45 CFR Part 164. It establishes national standards for the protection of individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, the request for the medical files of the train crew members by the plaintiff raises significant privacy concerns regarding the employees' health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally prohibits the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without authorization, except in certain defined circumstances.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer:**
   - **Forbid:** Given the sensitive nature of the medical information being requested and the lack of clear relevance to the case at hand, the HIPAA Privacy Rule likely forbids the disclosure of the train crew members' medical files in this situation. Union Pacific's objections based on concerns over violating HIPAA and other medical privacy laws are valid, and the request appears to be overly broad and not directly related to the core legal issues in the wrongful death action. The balance between legal discovery and individual privacy rights should be carefully weighed, and in this instance, protecting the employees' private health information would likely take precedence.
