Specifically, **HIPAA Privacy Rule 45 CFR 164.512(e)** permits the disclosure of PHI in response to a court order or subpoena.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:** In this case, the disclosure of Antoinne D. Thomas's personal health information to the defendants' legal representatives appears to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's provisions for disclosures related to legal proceedings. Given that the request for information is in response to a legal process initiated due to the lawsuit and aims to gather evidence relevant to the claims of injury, it is likely permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Response:** Permit

In conclusion, based on the provided information and the steps outlined, the disclosure of Antoinne D.
