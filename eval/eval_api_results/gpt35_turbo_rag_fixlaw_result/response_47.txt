### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part 164) and Content:**
   - Check the relevant HIPAA regulations, specifically Part 164, to understand the requirements and provisions related to the privacy of personal health information.

2. **Determination of Compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - Evaluate whether the actions taken by the hospital officials in denying Dustin J. Merryfield's request to access his medical and treatment records comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Assessment Result:**
   - **Answer: Forbid**
   - The denial of access to Merryfield's medical records by the hospital, citing reasons related to legal proceedings and protections against unwarranted disclosures, appears to conflict with the fundamental principles of transparency and patient rights outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the actions taken by the hospital officials appear to forbid compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
