Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The relevant sections of HIPAA for privacy and security rules are found in Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR), Part 164.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this scenario, the disclosure of Rodriguez's medical information without his consent to the District Attorney's Office raises concerns regarding HIPAA compliance.
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires patient authorization before disclosing protected health information for purposes such as law enforcement investigations.
   - Exceptions to this rule exist, such as in response to a court order or grand jury subpoena. However, these exceptions have specific requirements.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer:**
   - In this case, the disclosure of Rodriguez's medical records without his consent was done in response to a grand jury subpoena. While this can be permissible under HIPAA, the healthcare provider must ensure that the disclosure complies with HIPAA's requirements for such situations.
   - Given the complex nature of this case, it is advisable to conduct a detailed review of the specific circumstances to determine whether the disclosure was in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Therefore, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule in this case is **Permit**, with the caveat that further scrutiny is necessary to ensure full compliance with HIPAA regulations.
