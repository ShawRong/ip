3. **Compliance Assessment**:
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally restricts the disclosure of individually identifiable health information without authorization, aiming to protect individuals' privacy rights.
   - Given that the information requested includes sensitive health-related details, disclosing the names of claimants and specific dates of alleged torts may violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
