Based on the provided case involving Mr. Frederick Beaty and the medical malpractice lawsuit against St. Luke's Hospital and other parties, we can assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule using the following steps:

1. **Check HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content**: 
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 164) establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
   - It governs the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) by covered entities.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**: 
   - In this case, the issue revolves around the sharing of Mr. Beaty's medical information for legal defense purposes without a specific authorization for Dr. Weinstein.
   - HIPAA generally requires a patient's explicit authorization for the disclosure of PHI, especially for legal proceedings.
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not explicitly address ex parte sharing of medical information between defendants and non-retained experts like Dr. Weinstein for legal defense purposes.
   - However, this situation raises concerns about patient privacy and the need for clear authorization for such disclosures.

3. **Answer**: 
   - **Response: Forbid**
  
Therefore, in this context, the ex parte sharing of Mr. Beaty's medical information between the defendants and Dr. Weinstein without specific authorization for legal defense purposes likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
