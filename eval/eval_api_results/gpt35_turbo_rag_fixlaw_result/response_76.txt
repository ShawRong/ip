Based on the provided case and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, let's assess whether the Department's response complies with the HIPAA regulations:

1. **Checking HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found in 45 CFR Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It governs how covered entities can use and disclose protected health information (PHI).

2. **Determining compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule**: In this case, the Department's decision to withhold specific information about individual facilities, such as names, dates, and outcomes, from the statistical report aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's intent to safeguard patient privacy. By avoiding the potential identification of individuals involved in abuse allegations, the Department is demonstrating a commitment to protecting PHI.

3. **Answering whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**: The Department's approach to providing aggregated data while safeguarding specific identifying details is in line with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which permits covered entities to disclose PHI for certain purposes while ensuring the protection of individuals' privacy. Therefore, the Department's decision to withhold specific facility names to prevent potential identification aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's requirements.

**Conclusion**: In this case, the Department's response appears to be compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. By prioritizing patient privacy and taking measures to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of protected health information, the Department has appropriately balanced the public's right to information with the imperative to protect individual privacy, as mandated by HIPAA regulations.
