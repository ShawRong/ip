### Response:
Based on the provided case involving Spring Harbor Hospital and the federal grand jury subpoena, we will assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - Part 164 of the HIPAA regulation includes provisions related to the Security and Privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI). These regulations outline the standards for safeguarding patient information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this scenario, the hospital is faced with a federal grand jury subpoena requesting sensitive patient information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of PHI without patient authorization in response to a subpoena in certain circumstances, including for law enforcement purposes.

3. **Answer (Permit or Forbid): Permit**
   - Considering the nature of the request, which is related to a federal investigation and falls within the exceptions outlined in HIPAA for disclosure without patient consent, the disclosure in response to the subpoena is permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Spring Harbor Hospital, in this case, can disclose the information requested by the federal grand jury without explicit patient consent due to the legal nature of the request and the exceptions provided under HIPAA for disclosures to law enforcement entities.
