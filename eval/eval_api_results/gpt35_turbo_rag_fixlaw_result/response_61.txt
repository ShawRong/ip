Based on the provided case involving Kevin Dwayne Kennemur and the disclosure of his private health information from Yoakum County Hospital to law enforcement officials without his consent, we need to assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs in this case are likely found in **45 CFR Part 164** which pertains to the Security and Privacy rules of HIPAA. These regulations outline the standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this scenario, the disclosure of Kennemur's health information without his consent to law enforcement officials raises concerns regarding HIPAA compliance.
   
3. **Conclusion:**
   - **Forbid**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally forbids the disclosure of protected health information without patient consent, unless permitted by law. While there are certain situations where disclosure without consent is allowed (such as for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations), in this case involving law enforcement and a subpoena, the disclosure without consent should be carefully assessed for compliance with HIPAA regulations.

Given the circumstances described in the case, the disclosure of Kennemur's private health information to law enforcement without his consent likely raises issues of HIPAA compliance and patient privacy rights. Further legal analysis and consideration of specific HIPAA provisions would be necessary to determine the exact compliance status.
