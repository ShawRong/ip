### Response:
Based on the provided case scenario, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule: 45 CFR Part 164 outlines the standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The actions described, particularly the defense counsel's communication with Dr. Moser without patient consent, raise concerns about the confidentiality of Moss's private health information.
   
3. **Conclusion:**
   - **Forbid**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally prohibits the disclosure of protected health information without patient authorization, except in specific circumstances outlined in the rule. In this case, the defense counsel's communication without Moss's consent may violate HIPAA regulations regarding the protection of private health information.

Therefore, in this context, the actions taken by the defense counsel could be considered as going against the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
