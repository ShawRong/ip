Based on the provided case involving the unauthorized sharing of protected health information (PHI) between Dr. Pinckert and the defendant's counsel without the patient's knowledge or consent, it is evident that this situation raises significant concerns about patient privacy and compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule: This rule, as outlined in 45 CFR Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - **Response:** Forbid

### Explanation:
The actions described in the case, where PHI was shared without the patient's knowledge or consent, directly contravene the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The rule mandates that PHI can only be disclosed for certain purposes with explicit patient authorization or as permitted by law. In this case, the ex parte communications between Dr. Pinckert and the defendant's counsel, involving the sharing of sensitive medical information without the patient's consent, violate the patient's privacy rights and do not comply with HIPAA regulations.

Therefore, based on the assessment of the case, the actions taken by the defendant's legal team in sharing PHI without patient consent are in violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and are forbidden.
