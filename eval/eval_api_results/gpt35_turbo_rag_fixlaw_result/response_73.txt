Based on the provided case involving the disclosure of information about Alabama policyholders with similar health insurance policies from JALIC and Fortis from 1998 through 2005, we need to assess its compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The relevant sections of the HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to this case are:
     - ยง164.512(e)(1)(i) - Permits the disclosure of protected health information in response to a court order.
     - ยง164.512(e)(1)(ii) - Permits the disclosure in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process.
     - ยง164.512(e)(1)(iii) - Permits the disclosure in response to a request by a party to a proceeding if certain steps are taken to protect the information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this context, the disclosure of names and addresses of Alabama policyholders with similar health insurance policies from JALIC and Fortis for the purpose of litigation aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
  
3. **Answer: Permit**

Therefore, based on the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the circumstances outlined in the case, the disclosure of information as ordered by the court falls within the allowances provided by the rule, ensuring that protected health information is disclosed under strict conditions and solely for the purpose of the ongoing litigation.
