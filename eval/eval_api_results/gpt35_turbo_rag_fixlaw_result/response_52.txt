### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part 164) Checked:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule primarily found in 45 CFR Part 164 establishes the standards for the protection of individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determination of Compliance with HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - Given the scenario described, the disclosure of James A1 White's sensitive health information by nurse practitioner Drexel Jordan to the court without the patient's consent raises significant ethical and legal considerations.
   
3. **Compliance Assessment:**
   - **Step 1:** The relevant HIPAA regulations under Part 164 primarily focus on safeguarding the confidentiality and security of protected health information (PHI).
   
   - **Step 2:** The disclosure of James's HIV status by Drexel Jordan without his consent appears to conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's general principles, which typically require patient authorization or a court order for such disclosures.
   
   - **Step 3:** **Forbid** - In this case, the disclosure of James A1 White's HIV status by Drexel Jordan to the court without patient consent likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule unless there was a specific legal exception or court order authorizing such disclosure.

Given the circumstances outlined, the actions taken seem to contradict the standard privacy protections accorded to medical information under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
