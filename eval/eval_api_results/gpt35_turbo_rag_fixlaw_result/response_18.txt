Based on the given case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   The HIPAA Privacy Rule, under 45 CFR Part 164, establishes the standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It governs how healthcare providers and their business associates can handle protected health information (PHI).

2. **Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   In this scenario, the disclosure of the decedent's roommate's information by LTC was done in response to a legal process, specifically a motion to compel discovery in a malpractice case. The court permitted this disclosure under a "qualified protective order," ensuring the information's limited use for litigation purposes and its eventual return or destruction. This approach aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's provisions for disclosures in legal proceedings.

3. **Step 3: Response - Permit**
   Considering the circumstances and the court's decision to allow the disclosure under a qualified protective order, it can be concluded that in this case, the disclosure of the roommate's information is permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
