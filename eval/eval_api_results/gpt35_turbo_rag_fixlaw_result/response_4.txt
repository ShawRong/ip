Based on the provided case, let's assess its compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs under Part 164 primarily govern the security and privacy of protected health information (PHI). These regulations outline the standards for protecting PHI in various forms.

### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it seems that the disclosure of PHI by the covered entities for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations aligns with the permissible uses outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The scenario describes a situation where PHI is being shared for essential functions within the healthcare system.

### Step 3:
Given the context provided, the flow of private information in this case would likely be **permitted** by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The routine sharing of PHI for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations, without explicit patient consent but within the boundaries of the regulations, suggests compliance with the rule's provisions.

Therefore, based on the assessment, the case appears to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule by permitting the flow of private information for necessary healthcare functions.
