### Response:
Based on the provided case involving Christopher Richard Murray, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be conducted as follows:

1. **Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   Upon reviewing the case, it is essential to refer to the relevant sections of the HIPAA Privacy Rule within Part 164 to understand the regulations that pertain to the protection of medical information.

2. **Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   Considering the circumstances outlined in the case, it appears that the state obtained Murray's medical records, including the blood-alcohol test results, through a grand jury subpoena without his consent. This action raises concerns regarding the privacy rights safeguarded by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Step 3: Assessment - Please use Permit or Forbid to answer:**
   In this scenario, the act of acquiring and utilizing Murray's medical information for legal prosecution without his consent may potentially conflict with the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of such sensitive medical data without proper authorization could be deemed as forbidden under HIPAA regulations, particularly concerning the protection of an individual's health information.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the case involving Christopher Richard Murray and the principles outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule, it appears that the actions taken by the state in obtaining and using his medical records without consent may be considered as **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
