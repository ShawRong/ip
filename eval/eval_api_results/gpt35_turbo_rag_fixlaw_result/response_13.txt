### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule can be found in 45 CFR Part 164. This rule sets national standards for the protection of individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
   
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, the sharing of Y.P.'s medical records by the Red Lake Children Services with the FBI without explicit consent raises concerns about compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   
3. **Answer: Forbid**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires explicit patient authorization for the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) unless an exception applies. In this case, it seems that sharing Y.P.'s medical records without consent may not align with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as the situation described does not clearly fall within any of the permitted exceptions for disclosure without authorization.

It is important to ensure that patient privacy and confidentiality are maintained in accordance with HIPAA regulations, and in situations like this, it would be advisable to carefully review the specifics of the case and seek legal advice to determine the appropriate course of action that complies with HIPAA regulations while also addressing the welfare and safety concerns of the child involved.
