   - Considering the details of the case, it seems that A.M.'s situation involves sensitive medical and personal information being accessed and shared without her continuing consent. This raises concerns regarding HIPAA compliance.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer**:
   - **Forbid**: In the context described, the actions taken by the Department of Aging Services and Bernard, particularly in accessing and sharing A.M.'s private information without her ongoing consent, may not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's requirements for protecting patient confidentiality and privacy.
