1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - Part 164 of the HIPAA regulation covers the Security and Privacy Rules. It outlines the standards for protecting health information.

2. **Determination on whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The case involving Olsen and Shaw's disclosure of patient information to the Maine DHHS under Section 10 of the MMMA raises concerns about compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
