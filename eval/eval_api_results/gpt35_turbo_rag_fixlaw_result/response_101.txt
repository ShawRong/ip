Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:** The relevant sections of the HIPAA Privacy Rule pertain to the protection of individuals' medical records and other personal health information. Under the HIPAA regulation, healthcare providers are required to ensure the confidentiality and security of patient information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:** In this case, Denali Orthopedic Surgery's repeated requests for ex parte communication with Harrold-Jones's healthcare providers appear to conflict with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Rule generally prohibits the disclosure of a patient's medical information without their explicit authorization, except in certain permitted circumstances.

3. **Assessment:** Considering the details provided, Denali's requests for ex parte communication without Harrold-Jones's consent likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Harrold-Jones's refusal to grant such authorizations aligns with her rights under HIPAA to control who can access her medical information. Therefore, in this scenario, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would forbid Denali's requests for ex parte communication without proper authorization from the patient.

### Conclusion:
- **Compliance Assessment:** The actions taken by Denali Orthopedic Surgery, particularly in requesting ex parte communications without consent, do not align with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
- **Verdict:** **Forbid** - Denali's repeated requests for access to Harrold-Jones's medical information without proper authorization violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which emphasizes patient confidentiality and control over their health information.
