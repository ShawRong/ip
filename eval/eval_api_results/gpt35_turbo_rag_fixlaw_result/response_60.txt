### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - **HIPAA Regulation IDs relevant to this case:**
     - HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 164)
  
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - **Answer:** Forbid

Explanation:
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes the standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information. In this case, engaging in ex parte interviews with treating physicians without the patient's consent raises significant privacy concerns.
- According to HIPAA, protected health information can generally only be disclosed without authorization for purposes such as treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. In the context described, the planned communications with Caldwell's healthcare providers do not fall within these permitted categories.
- Without Caldwell's consent, the disclosure of her health information to Dr. Castro's legal team for the purpose of building a defense strategy likely violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
- To ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations, alternative methods that respect patient privacy and confidentiality should be considered for gathering information relevant to the case.
