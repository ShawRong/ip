Based on the provided case involving Elwyn, Inc. and D.M., we need to assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the following steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content.**
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case.**
3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer.**

After reviewing the case details, it appears that the disclosure of sensitive information requested by D.M. in the legal battle against Elwyn, Inc. raises significant privacy concerns. The HIPAA Privacy Rule, particularly 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.512(e), allows for certain disclosures in legal proceedings under specific conditions. 

Given the circumstances outlined in the case, it seems that Elwyn's resistance to disclosing the extensive private information requested by D.M. is in line with the intent of protecting individual privacy and confidentiality. Releasing such detailed documents, including incident reports, witness statements, and investigatory findings, without explicit consent from the involved individuals, could potentially violate the privacy rights safeguarded under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Therefore, in this scenario, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely **Forbid** the requested disclosures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals not directly involved in the lawsuit.
