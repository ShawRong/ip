### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content**:
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule is governed by various sections under Part 164 of the HIPAA regulations. These sections outline the standards for protecting individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It is crucial to review these specific regulations to understand the requirements and limitations imposed by HIPAA in this context.

2. **Determination of Compliance**:
   - In the case described, Ross Cashen's acquisition of Jane Doe's mental health records without her consent raises significant concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   
3. **Compliance Assessment**:
   - The actions taken by Cashen's legal team and the private investigator in obtaining Doe's mental health records without her consent likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which generally requires the patient's authorization for the disclosure of their protected health information (PHI).
   
4. **Conclusion**:
   - In this scenario, the disclosure of Doe's mental health records without her consent likely **forbids** compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The unauthorized access to and use of her private health information present serious legal and ethical implications that need to be addressed within the framework of HIPAA regulations.
