Based on the provided case involving Lesha Carter and her minor child Jazyhia Carter, an assessment of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be made as follows:

### Step 1:
- The HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) outline the detailed requirements for a valid authorization under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, including elements such as a specific description of the information to be disclosed, the names of individuals or entities authorized to make the disclosure, and a clear indication of the purpose of the disclosure.

### Step 2:
- Considering the case described, the non-compliant authorization forms sent by the Carters lack the necessary elements outlined in the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164). As a result, the healthcare providers were unable to lawfully access the plaintiffs' medical records.

### Step 3:
- **Verdict: Forbid**
- The case involving Lesha and Jazyhia Carter does not comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the absence of essential elements in the authorization forms. Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the access to the medical records based on the non-compliant authorization forms provided by the Carters.
