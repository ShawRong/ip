### Response:
1. **Checking the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 164) governs the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI).
  
2. **Determining whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - **Answer:** Forbid
  
3. **Explanation:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule strictly prohibits the disclosure of protected health information without individual consent or a court order. In this case, the health records of the witnesses, maintained by NMCD, fall under protected health information and cannot be disclosed without proper authorization. The defense's request to access these records without consent or a court order goes against the privacy rights safeguarded by the HIPAA regulations. Thus, in this scenario, the HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the disclosure of the witnesses' health records.
