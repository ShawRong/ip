Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the specified steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule can be found in 45 CFR Part 164. This rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this scenario, the disclosure of Peltz's blood alcohol content (BAC) without his explicit consent raises concerns about HIPAA compliance. While there are provisions for disclosures without consent in certain law enforcement situations, they are usually limited and require careful consideration.

3. **Answer (Permit or Forbid):**
   - **Forbid:** Given the sensitivity of medical information like BAC levels and the lack of explicit consent from the patient, the disclosure of this information to law enforcement may not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's requirements. Patient privacy rights should be upheld unless specific exceptions apply.

It's crucial to ensure that any disclosures of protected health information comply with HIPAA regulations to safeguard patient privacy and rights, even in situations involving law enforcement investigations.
