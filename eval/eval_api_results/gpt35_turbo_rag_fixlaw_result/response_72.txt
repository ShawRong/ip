### Response:

Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Checking HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found in 45 CFR Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It governs the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) by covered entities.

2. **Determining whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**: In this case, the disclosure of Kirsch's blood-alcohol test results to law enforcement without his explicit consent raises concerns regarding HIPAA compliance. The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires patient authorization for the release of PHI unless there are specific circumstances that permit disclosure without authorization.

3. **Answer**: The disclosure of Kirsch's blood-alcohol test results to law enforcement without his explicit consent likely **forbids** compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. While there are exceptions that allow disclosures without patient consent for law enforcement purposes, such disclosures must typically be made in response to a court order, subpoena, or other legal process. In this case, the decision to share the test results appears to lack a clear legal basis under HIPAA.

It's important to note that while there may be a perceived need to share information with law enforcement for investigative purposes, healthcare providers must navigate such situations carefully to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations and patient privacy rights.
