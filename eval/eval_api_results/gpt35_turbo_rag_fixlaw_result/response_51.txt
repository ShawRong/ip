### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule is outlined in 45 CFR Part 164. This regulation governs the protection of individually identifiable health information, known as protected health information (PHI), by covered entities and business associates. It establishes the standards for the use and disclosure of PHI.

2. **Determination:**
   - The case involving Kanay Mubita's HIV status implicates several aspects of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. It is essential to evaluate whether the disclosures of his health information align with the permissible uses and disclosures outlined in the HIPAA regulations.

3. **Compliance Assessment: Permit or Forbid**
   - **Permit**: 
     - Disclosure to public health authorities as required by law, such as reporting of communicable diseases like HIV.
     - Sharing information for treatment purposes or with entities providing HIV-related services.
   - **Forbid**:
     - Unauthorized disclosure to parties not involved in treatment, payment, or healthcare operations without patient consent.
     - Inappropriate sharing of sensitive health information for non-healthcare related purposes.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the disclosures made by healthcare providers and the health department align with the permitted uses and disclosures under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. However, the release of Mubita's health records to the Latah County Prosecutorâ€™s Office without explicit consent appears to raise concerns regarding patient confidentiality and compliance with HIPAA regulations. It is crucial to further investigate the circumstances surrounding this disclosure to determine its compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
