Based on the described case involving Michael J. McGill and the disclosure of his medical records from Reynolds Memorial Hospital to the court for the criminal investigation against him, it is necessary to assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Assessment:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (Part164) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule, found in 45 CFR Part 164, establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The disclosure of Michael J. McGill's medical records to the court under a legal directive falls within the exceptions provided by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   
3. **Answer: Permit**

### Explanation:
- The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of protected health information without patient authorization in certain situations, such as for law enforcement purposes through a court order.
- In this case, the disclosure of McGill's health records to the court was legally sanctioned under specific provisions that permit the release of private health information in the context of judicial proceedings.
- While the disclosure might seem like an intrusion into McGill's privacy, the existence of a court order bypasses the usual consent requirements and allows for such disclosures to aid in legal investigations.

The actions taken by Reynolds Memorial Hospital and the court align with the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule in this particular scenario.
