### Response: Forbid

The HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the disclosure of sensitive patient information unless there is a valid reason or legal basis for such disclosure. In this case, the DEA's subpoena seeking comprehensive medical information without patient consent and the instruction to withhold information from the affected patients for a year violate the privacy protections established by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Dr. Zadeh's concerns about potential violations of state and federal privacy regulations are justified, as patient privacy rights should be upheld even in the context of law enforcement investigations.
