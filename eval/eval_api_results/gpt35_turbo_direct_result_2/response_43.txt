### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the practice described in the case. This is because the unauthorized sale of de-identified patient information, even if stripped of direct identifiers, goes against the core principles of patient privacy and confidentiality outlined in the HIPAA regulations. By not obtaining explicit consent for such transactions and by using patient data for commercial purposes without proper authorization, CVS Caremark Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. have violated the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
