### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the release of Josh Sanchez's SSODA evaluation to the King County Sheriffâ€™s Office. While Washington state law mandates the sharing of relevant information about sex offenders for community risk assessments, HIPAA regulations protect the privacy of an individual's health information, including psychological evaluations. In this case, the release of the SSODA evaluation without Sanchez's explicit consent would violate HIPAA regulations.
