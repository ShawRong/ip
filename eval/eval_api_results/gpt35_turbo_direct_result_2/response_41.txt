### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the issuance of subpoenas seeking Morris's medical records, employment records, unemployment compensation records, and Social Security application without proper authorization or patient consent. This rule protects the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' health information and restricts its disclosure without valid reasons or legal authority. The legal teams involved should ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations when handling sensitive personal information in the context of litigation to uphold privacy rights and maintain ethical practices.
