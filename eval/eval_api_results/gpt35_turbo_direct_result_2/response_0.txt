### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of detailed health plan information, especially individual claims experience and the identities of covered dependents, as described in the case. This is due to the sensitive nature of personal health information and the need to protect the privacy of individuals covered by the health plans. The City's limitation of disclosed information aligns with the Privacy Rule's requirements to safeguard personal health information from unauthorized access.
