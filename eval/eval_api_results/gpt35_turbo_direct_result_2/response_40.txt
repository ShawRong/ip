### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the broad scope of discovery requests in this case. The defendant's concerns about protecting the privacy of non-party information, particularly sensitive Personal Health Information (PHI) and personal financial information, are valid under laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The court should consider safeguarding PHI under 45 CFR ยง 164.530(c)(2) and ensure that the disclosure of such information is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of litigation while respecting individuals' privacy rights.
