### Response:
The actions taken by the defense counsel in sending a letter to Dr. Moser just before his evidence deposition, containing detailed medical opinions about Moss's condition without his consent, **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This unauthorized disclosure of private health information without patient consent violates the confidentiality provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which safeguards patients' protected health information.
