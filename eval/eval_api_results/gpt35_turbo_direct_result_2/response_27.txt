### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of Esther A. Broderick's medical records to Margaret R. Puls in this scenario. Since there was no consent provided by Broderick or a legally authorized representative for the disclosure, and the purpose of the request is related to a legal dispute concerning the validity of a will, the disclosure of Broderick's medical records in this context would not be permitted under HIPAA regulations.
