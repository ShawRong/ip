### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the sharing of private medical information in this case. Shanks had legally consented to the disclosure by signing a release authorizing access to her medical records. The information shared was deemed essential for the legal proceedings, specifically to assess the impact of her amputation on her job performance and to evaluate the alleged discrimination.
