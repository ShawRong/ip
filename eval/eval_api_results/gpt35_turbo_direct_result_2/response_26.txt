### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of the requested medical data without individual player authorization. The U.S. NHL Clubs, as healthcare providers, must adhere to HIPAA regulations that protect the privacy of patients' medical information. Releasing sensitive medical records without explicit consent would violate these privacy standards. Therefore, the plaintiffs cannot access the medical data from the U.S. NHL Clubs without proper authorization from the players involved.
