### Response: Permit

The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the limited ex parte communications under a qualified protective order in this case. The court's decision to grant the defendants' request for specific discussions with Mary's health care providers, with strict limitations excluding private information about her mental health unless directly relevant to the lawsuit, aligns with the balance required between legal processes and patient privacy rights under HIPAA regulations.
