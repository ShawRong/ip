### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the transfer of Michael J. McGill's medical records from Reynolds Memorial Hospital to the court without his consent in normal circumstances. However, in this case, a court order compelled the hospital to release the records, which is legally permitted under specific provisions allowing for disclosure in the context of judicial proceedings.
