### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the sharing of A.S.'s mental health evaluation between Rutland Mental Health Services, Inc. (RMHS) and the probate court. This permission is based on the necessity of the evaluation for the legal proceedings related to A.S.'s guardianship status. The court's actions in handling and requesting the evaluation were within the boundaries of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, considering the context of the case and the need to assess A.S.'s capacity for voluntary guardianship.
