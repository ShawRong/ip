### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the sharing of Protected Health Information (PHI) in the described case. The situation involved the sharing of sensitive PHI with parties not directly involved in the healthcare operations or payment, which goes against the strict privacy rules outlined in HIPAA. The sharing of individual medical claims and actions of the Plaintiff's board with individuals not directly engaged in healthcare activities is a violation of HIPAA regulations.
