### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of protected health information about qualifying patients to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) without explicit consent from the patients for purposes such as audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure actions under Section 10 of the Maine Medical Marijuana Act (MMMA). Olsen and Shaw would be in violation of HIPAA regulations if they were to disclose patient information without explicit patient consent, even if it is required by state law. The conflict between state law and federal privacy protections in this case highlights the challenges faced by healthcare providers in balancing regulatory compliance with patient privacy.
