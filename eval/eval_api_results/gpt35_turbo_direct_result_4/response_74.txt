### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of the detailed documents about previous cases, including incident reports, witness statements, investigatory findings, and emails regarding allegations of sexual contact, as requested by D.M. The rule prioritizes the privacy and confidentiality of individuals not directly involved in the lawsuit, and in this case, the disclosure of such sensitive information without the explicit consent of the subjects involved or addressing their privacy rights would violate HIPAA regulations.
