### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the act of obtaining medical information from Dr. Harris without explicit consent from the patient, Dr. Crenshaw. This breaches the privacy regulations outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which specifically protect individuals' health information from unauthorized disclosure. Dr. Harris's involvement in providing insights without proper consent raises significant legal and ethical concerns, especially regarding patient privacy rights and the handling of sensitive health information.
