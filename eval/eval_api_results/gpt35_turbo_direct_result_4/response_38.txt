### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the case. Laura Mais, by explicitly allowing the hospital and healthcare professionals to use Mark's health information for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations, effectively granted consent for the disclosure of his information to entities involved in billing and debt collection processes. This aligns with the permissions outlined in the Notice of Privacy Practices provided by the hospital.
