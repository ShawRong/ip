### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the defendants from obtaining the medical records of the plaintiffs from their treating physicians without proper authorization or consent from the plaintiffs. The Privacy Rule strictly regulates the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) and requires authorization from the patient for such disclosures, except in specific circumstances outlined by the regulation. In this case, where the defendants are seeking access to PHI for use in a legal defense, they must adhere to the requirements of the Privacy Rule, which emphasizes patient privacy and confidentiality. Without explicit authorization from the plaintiffs or meeting the necessary conditions specified by HIPAA, the defendants are not permitted to access the plaintiffs' medical records for their legal strategy.
