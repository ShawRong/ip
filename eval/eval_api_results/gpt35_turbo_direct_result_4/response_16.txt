### Response:
The action of defense counsel sending a detailed narrative of medical opinions to Dr. Moser without Moss's consent, just before his evidence deposition, is **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This unauthorized disclosure of private health information constitutes a breach of confidentiality and violates the patient's rights to privacy and protection of their medical information.
