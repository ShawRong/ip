### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the sharing of Protected Health Information (PHI) in this case without proper authorization and in a manner that is not compliant with HIPAA regulations. The handling of PHI by sharing sensitive medical information and individual medical claims with parties not directly involved in the health plan's management violates the privacy protections mandated by HIPAA.
