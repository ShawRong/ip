### Response: Forbid

The HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the actions described in the case. While the Florida law may require pharmacies to make prescription records available to law enforcement under certain circumstances, the transfer of such sensitive medical information without the patient's consent or a warrant violates the privacy rights guaranteed by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The rule sets strict standards for the protection of individuals' medical records and information, requiring authorization from the patient or a valid legal process like a warrant before disclosing such information. In this case, the transfer of the patient's prescription records to law enforcement without consent or a warrant goes against the privacy protections outlined in HIPAA.
