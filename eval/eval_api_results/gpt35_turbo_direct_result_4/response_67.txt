The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the ex parte sharing of Mr. Beaty's medical information between the defendants and Dr. Weinstein without a specific authorization for this purpose. This action raises concerns about the adequacy of patient authorizations in litigation contexts and the proper handling of protected health information under HIPAA regulations.
