### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the withholding of the psychotherapy notes by the therapist in this case. The court order demanding the release of the notes indicates that in this situation, the notes were considered relevant and necessary for legal proceedings, outweighing the therapist's interpretation of privacy rules. This decision underscores the importance of disclosing such information when it is deemed crucial for legal matters, even if consent has been provided by a third party.
