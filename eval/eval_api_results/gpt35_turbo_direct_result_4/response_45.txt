### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of Gary Abeyta's treatment records in the context described in the case. The disclosure of his confidential mental health information without his explicit consent for use in a legal defense and discovery process goes against the principles of patient privacy and confidentiality outlined in the HIPAA regulations.
