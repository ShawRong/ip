### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the case. Merryfield's request to access his medical and treatment records was denied by the hospital's privacy officer and medical director citing that his records were not eligible for disclosure due to their compilation in anticipation of, or for use in, legal proceedings. This decision was made in adherence to HIPAA's protections against unwarranted disclosures, ultimately barring Merryfield from accessing his own health information.
