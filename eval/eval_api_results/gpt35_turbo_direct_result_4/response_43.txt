### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the case described in the scenario. The unauthorized sale of de-identified patient information by CVS pharmacies violates HIPAA regulations, which are designed to protect the privacy and security of individuals' health information. De-identification of data does not grant carte blanche for its commercial exploitation without patient consent, especially when it involves sensitive health details. CVS's actions in this scenario constitute a breach of patient trust and privacy rights under HIPAA regulations.
