### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the release of specific information about individual facilities in this case, as it could potentially lead to the identification of individuals involved in sensitive health-related matters, thus breaching privacy rules. The Department's decision to withhold specific information to protect individuals' privacy aligns with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which sets stringent conditions for the handling and disclosure of individuals' health information to safeguard their privacy.
