### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the disclosure of protected health information in the course of judicial and administrative proceedings, under specific circumstances outlined in 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.512(e). In this case, the court authorized the Dallas Fire Rescue Department (DF-R) to comply with the City of Dallas's subpoena for Booth's paramedic records, with stringent conditions to ensure the protection and confidentiality of Booth's health information. This decision was made considering the legal standards, relevance of the information sought, and compliance with HIPAA regulations governing the permissible disclosure of health information in legal proceedings.
