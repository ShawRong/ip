### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Permits** the disclosure of Theresa Lee Elam's protected health information (PHI) in this case. The court order allowing the release of Elam's medical records to the attorneys involved in the medical negligence lawsuit falls within the framework of HIPAA regulations, which permit the disclosure of PHI for judicial proceedings when authorized by a court order.
