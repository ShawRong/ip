### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of the health records of the witnesses without their individual consent or a court order. This is in accordance with the strict requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule which protect the privacy rights of individuals and mandate that healthcare information can only be disclosed under specific circumstances defined by the law. In this case, the defense's request to access the health records without proper consent or a court mandate violates the privacy protections established by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
