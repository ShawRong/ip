### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Permits** the disclosure of psychotherapy notes in this case, as the plaintiff explicitly authorized the release of her medical information, including the psychotherapy notes, for use in the lawsuit. This authorization, along with the federal legal framework and specific regulations cited, allowed for the disclosure under 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.508(a)(2) and ยง 164.512(e) within the context of legal proceedings.
