### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of a patient's medical information to law enforcement without explicit consent unless required by law or in certain circumstances such as emergencies. In this case, although there were suspicions of intoxication and the belief that sharing the blood-alcohol test results was crucial for the investigation, the disclosure of Kirsch's medical information without his consent to law enforcement goes against HIPAA regulations.
