### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the sharing of detailed health plan information, especially individual claims experience and the identities of covered dependents, in this case. This information falls under protected health information (PHI) and disclosing it without proper authorization would violate the privacy rights guaranteed by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
