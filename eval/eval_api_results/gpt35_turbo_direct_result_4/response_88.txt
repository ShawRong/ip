### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the unauthorized sharing of protected health information (PHI) between Dr. Pinckert and the defendant's counsel. This action directly contravenes the stringent requirements set by HIPAA for the protection and disclosure of PHI, especially in the context of litigation. Patient privacy must be respected, and sharing PHI without explicit consent from the patient violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
