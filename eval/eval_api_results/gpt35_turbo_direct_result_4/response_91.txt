### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the release of K.B.'s therapy records to her father without a court order, as it was deemed medically necessary to protect her mental and physical health. Meridian Health Services Corporation's decision to withhold the records aligns with the patient's rights under health privacy laws and the necessity to safeguard K.B.'s well-being and therapeutic space.
