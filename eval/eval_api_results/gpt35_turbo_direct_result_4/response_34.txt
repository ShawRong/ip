### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of patients' private medical information without their explicit consent, unless required by law or for specific purposes such as treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. In this case, the broad subpoenas requesting sensitive medical records without patient consent would likely violate HIPAA regulations. The concerns raised by the non-party law firms regarding privacy and privilege protections align with the principles of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
