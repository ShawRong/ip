### Response:
The scenario described in the case study where the OIG agents of the United States Postal Service accessed healthcare providers to obtain personal medical information of USPS employees without their knowledge or consent is **forbidden** by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This action violates the privacy rights of the employees as protected health information should not be accessed without proper authorization or consent from the individuals involved. The justification provided by the OIG agents does not align with the requirements and restrictions set forth by the HIPAA regulations, which prioritize the protection and confidentiality of individuals' health information.
