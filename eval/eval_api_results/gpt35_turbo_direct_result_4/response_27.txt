### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of Esther A. Broderick's medical records from Medicalodge to Margaret R. Puls without the consent of Broderick or a legally authorized representative. This case involves sensitive medical information and privacy rights, which are protected under HIPAA regulations. Since there is no mention of consent from the patient or a representative, the disclosure of the medical records for the purpose of contesting the will's validity would not be permitted under HIPAA.
