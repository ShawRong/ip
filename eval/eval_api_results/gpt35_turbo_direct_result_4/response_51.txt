### Response: 

The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of Mubita's health information by the Health Department to the Latah County Prosecutorâ€™s Office without Mubita's authorization. The disclosure of such sensitive health information without consent violates the patient's right to privacy as outlined in the HIPAA regulations.
