### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the scenario described in the case. The acquisition of Peltz's blood sample for medical purposes doesn't grant law enforcement the automatic right to access this information for investigatory purposes without explicit consent. Additionally, the overheard admission of alcohol consumption by Peltz during a private phone conversation in a hospital setting further underscores the violation of patient privacy regulations under HIPAA. The safeguarding of patient rights and the necessity of explicit consent are crucial aspects that must be upheld, even in situations where investigatory needs are pressing.
