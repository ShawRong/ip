### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of certain pieces of information requested by The Oregonian, such as the names of the claimants and some dates of the alleged torts, as this information is protected under privacy laws and regulations. This decision by OHSU to withhold certain details aligns with the regulations designed to protect individuals' privacy rights and prevent potential breaches of confidential information.
