### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the modified action taken by Sherri Smith. By restricting the disclosure strictly to "medical records and bills" and explicitly excluding private interviews with healthcare providers, she is exercising her right to limit the sharing of her daughter's private information, thus aligning with the Privacy Rule's emphasis on protecting patient privacy.
