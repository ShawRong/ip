Based on the provided case description, let's assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

### Step 1:
- **HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.506(c)(1)) and their content:**  
The HIPAA Privacy Rule under 45 CFR 164.506(c)(1) pertains to the "permitted uses and disclosures for which an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is not required." This section outlines certain situations where protected health information (PHI) can be used or disclosed without explicit patient authorization.

### Step 2:
- **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**  
In this scenario, the flow of private information within the healthcare ecosystem involves covered entities handling protected health information (PHI) for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. The case describes a situation where PHI is routinely used and disclosed for essential functions without explicit patient consent but within the boundaries of regulations that define PHI usage and disclosure.

### Step 3:
- **Answer - Permit or Forbid:**  
Given the context provided, the handling of protected health information in this case appears to align with the permitted uses and disclosures outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Therefore, the case seems to be **permitted** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

This assessment suggests that the described scenario, where PHI is shared for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations without explicit patient consent but within regulatory guidelines, is likely compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
