Based on the provided case description, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule through the outlined steps:

1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(g), 164.512(b)(1)(ii)) and their content**:  
   - **164.502(g)**: This section of the HIPAA Privacy Rule pertains to the uses and disclosures for which an authorization is required. It specifies the conditions under which protected health information (PHI) can be disclosed without patient authorization.
   - **164.512(b)(1)(ii)**: This part of the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows covered entities to disclose PHI to a health oversight agency for oversight activities authorized by law.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**:  
   - In this case, the disclosure of Y.P.'s medical records by the Red Lake Children Services to the FBI without explicit consent from the parent raises questions about compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
   - HIPAA generally permits the disclosure of PHI without patient authorization in cases of child abuse reporting to the appropriate authorities.

3. **Please use Permit or Forbid to answer**:  
   - **Permit**: Given the circumstances of suspected child abuse and the involvement of child protective services and law enforcement agencies, the disclosure of Y.P.'s medical records can be considered permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule for the purpose of protecting the child's welfare and ensuring justice.

It seems that in this specific case, the disclosure of Y.P.'s medical records to the FBI by the Red Lake Children Services can be justified under HIPAA regulations due to the serious nature of the situation involving suspected child abuse and the necessity to safeguard the child's well-being.
