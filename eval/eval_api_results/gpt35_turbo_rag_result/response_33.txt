### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.504(f)(2)(ii)(B)) and their content:**
   - HIPAA regulation 164.504(f)(2)(ii)(B) pertains to the permissible uses and disclosures for which an authorization is not required. It specifically addresses the release of protected health information for oversight activities conducted by a health oversight agency.
  
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - **Answer:** Forbid

Explanation: The actions described in the case, where the OIG agents accessed healthcare providers of USPS employees to obtain their personal medical information without the knowledge or consent of the employees, likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. HIPAA generally requires patient consent or authorization for the disclosure of protected health information, except in specific situations outlined in the regulations. This case appears to involve unauthorized access to sensitive medical records, which goes against the fundamental principles of patient privacy and consent enshrined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
