Based on the provided case involving Ella Ussery, the assessment of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be summarized as follows:

1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.502(g)(3)(ii)(C), 164.502(g)(3)(i)(A)):**
   - **164.502(g)(3)(ii)(C):** This section involves the permitted uses and disclosures for quality improvement activities. In this case, the discussions and consensus reached among medical professionals and Ella's parents regarding the withdrawal of life support could potentially fall under quality improvement activities, given the gravity of the decision and its impact on future patient care.
   - **164.502(g)(3)(i)(A):** This section pertains to the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. The discussions and documentation of consent for withdrawing life support would likely involve the use and disclosure of PHI for treatment purposes.

2. **Determination:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule likely permits the disclosures and uses of PHI in this case, given that they were necessary for treatment decisions and ensuring quality care for the patient.

3. **Conclusion:** The case is more likely to be in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosures and discussions involving PHI were essential for treatment decisions and ensuring that the decisions made were in the best interest of the patient.

Therefore, the case is more likely to be **Permitted** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
