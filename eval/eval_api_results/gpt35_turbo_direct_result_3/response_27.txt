### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of Esther A. Broderick's medical records to Margaret R. Puls without explicit authorization or consent, as required by HIPAA regulations. In this case, since there was no consent obtained from Broderick or a legally authorized representative mentioned for this disclosure, and the purpose of the request does not fall under one of the permitted uses, the disclosure of the medical records would not be permitted under HIPAA regulations.
