### Response:
The action of sending a detailed letter to Dr. Moser without Moss's consent, containing specific medical opinions and information crucial to the defense's case, is **forbidden** by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This unauthorized disclosure of private health information violates patient confidentiality and breaches the fiduciary relationship between a patient and their physician.
