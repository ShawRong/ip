### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the scenario described. This situation involves unauthorized disclosures of sensitive health information without the patient's consent, which goes against the core principles of patient privacy and confidentiality outlined in the HIPAA regulations. The court's decision to authorize such ex parte communications without Bobbie Jean's consent does not align with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which typically mandates patient authorization for the sharing of their health information, especially in legal contexts.
