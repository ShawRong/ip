### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the disclosure of the requested operative notes from the sigmoid colectomy and/or lower anterior resection procedures performed by Dr. Verazin in the five years preceding Mrs. Buckman's surgery, as long as the information is appropriately redacted to protect patient privacy. This decision aligns with the legal protocols outlined in 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.512(a), which allows for disclosures of protected health information in certain circumstances, such as for litigation purposes.
