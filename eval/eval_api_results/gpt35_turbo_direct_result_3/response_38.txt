### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the case. Laura Mais provided explicit consent for the hospital to use Mark's health information for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations, which includes disclosing information to parties involved in billing and collections, as stated in the hospital's Notice of Privacy Practices. Therefore, the subsequent flow of Mark's personal information through the various entities for billing and debt collection aligns with the permissions granted by Laura during the hospital admission process.
