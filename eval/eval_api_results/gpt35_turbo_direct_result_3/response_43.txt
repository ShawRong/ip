### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the case described. The unauthorized sale of de-identified patient information by CVS Caremark Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. violates the fundamental principles of patient privacy outlined in the HIPAA regulations. De-identification does not absolve entities from their obligation to protect patient data, especially when it is being sold for profit without patient consent. This practice undermines patient trust and privacy rights, going against the core tenets of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
