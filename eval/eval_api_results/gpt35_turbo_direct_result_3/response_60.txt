### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the case. 

Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the unauthorized disclosure of a patient's protected health information without their consent is generally prohibited. In this scenario, engaging in ex parte interviews with the treating physicians of the plaintiff, Stacey Caldwell, without her explicit consent would likely violate HIPAA regulations, as it involves sharing her health information without proper authorization. This unauthorized disclosure of protected health information could lead to serious legal consequences and penalties under HIPAA. It is essential to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations when handling patients' health information in legal proceedings.
