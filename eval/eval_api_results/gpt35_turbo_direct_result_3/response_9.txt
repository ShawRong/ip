### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of psychotherapy records in this case. Koch's revocation of authorization for the release of information about him should have been respected, and the district court's ruling suggesting an implied waiver of the psychotherapist-patient privilege was in error. Koch's actions align with his rights under HIPAA regulations, specifically regarding the revocation of consent for the disclosure of private health information.
