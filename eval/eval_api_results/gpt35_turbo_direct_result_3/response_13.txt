### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the sharing of Y.P.'s medical records by the Red Lake Children Services with the FBI without explicit consent from the parent or legal guardian. While the situation involving child abuse is indeed distressing and critical, HIPAA regulations strictly govern the disclosure of protected health information, requiring explicit authorization or specific circumstances outlined in the law to permit such sharing. In this case, without the explicit consent of the parent or legal guardian, the disclosure of Y.P.'s medical records to the FBI would be considered a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
