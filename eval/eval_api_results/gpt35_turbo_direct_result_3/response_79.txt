### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of the 911 tapes in this case. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) protects individual health information from unauthorized disclosure, and in this situation, the sensitive health information shared during the emergency call falls under the protected health information (PHI) category. Therefore, the refusal to grant access to the 911 tapes aligns with the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which prioritizes the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' health information.
