### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the withholding of the psychotherapy notes by the therapist, Georgia Howorth-Fair, in this case. Although the therapist believed the notes were her personal property and not subject to disclosure, HIPAA regulations prioritize the protection and privacy of an individual's health information. Despite Lori Evenson's consent for the release of her late husband's private health information, the therapist's refusal to disclose the psychotherapy notes conflicted with HIPAA regulations. The court's decision to demand the release of the notes indicates that, in this situation, the HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibited withholding such critical treatment details in the context of legal proceedings.
