### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the sharing of private medical information in this case. Dorothy Shanks provided legal consent by signing a release authorizing access to her medical records. The disclosure of her medical information was crucial for the legal proceedings and was deemed relevant and necessary to understand the extent of her physical condition and its impact on the alleged discrimination.
