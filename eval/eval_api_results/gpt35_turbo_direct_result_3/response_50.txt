### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the ex parte interviews with the plaintiffs' treating physicians in this case, as long as specific procedural safeguards are in place to protect patient privacy and confidentiality. The court's decision to allow these interviews while considering federal privacy standards and legal requirements signifies a balance between the need for discovery in litigation and the protection of patient privacy mandated by HIPAA.
