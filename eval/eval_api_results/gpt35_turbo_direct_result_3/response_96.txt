### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the release of Nigel Bray's complete medical records to Dr. Radwan Khuri solely based on the medical authorization signed by Deborah Bray for the purpose of preparing his defense in the healthcare liability claim. The Privacy Rule mandates that healthcare information should only be disclosed for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations unless authorized by the patient or required by law. In this case, the authorization for medical records appears to extend beyond what is permissible under HIPAA regulations.
