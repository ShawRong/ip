### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of Bauer's blood-alcohol test results by Carle Foundation Hospital to the Effingham County grand jury without his explicit consent. This case involves sensitive medical information that should have been protected under HIPAA regulations, as it was disclosed for legal purposes without the patient's authorization.
