### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the unauthorized disclosure of Kim's mental health records in this scenario. The disclosure of her private mental health records by St. Elizabethâ€™s Hospital without her explicit authorization or a court order violates the patient's privacy rights protected under HIPAA.
