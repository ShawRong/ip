### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the disclosure of protected health information in the course of judicial and administrative proceedings under specific circumstances, as outlined in 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.512(e). In this case, the court authorized the Dallas Fire Rescue Department to comply with the City's subpoena, ensuring the protection and confidential handling of Booth's health information. This decision was made considering the legal context, relevance of the information sought, and compliance with HIPAA regulations regarding permissible disclosure of health information in legal proceedings.
