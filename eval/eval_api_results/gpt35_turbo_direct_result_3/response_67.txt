### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the ex parte sharing of Mr. Beaty's medical information between the defendants and Dr. Weinstein in this case, particularly due to the absence of a specific authorization for Dr. Weinstein to review the records for legal defense purposes. This action raises concerns about violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's regulations on patient privacy and data sharing within legal contexts.
