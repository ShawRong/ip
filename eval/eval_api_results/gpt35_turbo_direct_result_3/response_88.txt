### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the unauthorized sharing of protected health information (PHI) between healthcare providers and third parties, including in the context of litigation. In this case, the ex parte communications between Dr. Pinckert and the defendant's counsel without Rosalynn's knowledge or consent violates HIPAA regulations that aim to safeguard patient privacy and control the flow of sensitive medical information.
