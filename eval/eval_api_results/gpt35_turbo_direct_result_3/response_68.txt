### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Permits** the case. Sherri Smith, as Carli's legal guardian, has the right to modify the medical authorization form to protect her daughter's privacy rights. By specifying the limited disclosure to only "medical records and bills" and excluding private interviews with healthcare providers except for Dr. Collins, Sherri is exercising her authority to control the sharing of Carli's medical information within the boundaries she deems appropriate. This action aligns with the Privacy Rule's objective of safeguarding patient privacy while allowing necessary information sharing for legal purposes.
