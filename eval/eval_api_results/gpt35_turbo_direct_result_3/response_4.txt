### Response:
The **HIPAA Privacy Rule permits** the routine uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI) described in the case, such as for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations, without the explicit consent of the patients. This allowance is based on the understanding that such disclosures are essential for the efficient functioning of the healthcare system while still maintaining the necessary protections for patient privacy and security.
