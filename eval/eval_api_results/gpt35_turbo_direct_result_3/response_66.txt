### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the case. 

The situation described involves a deviation from the standard compliance requirements for disclosing medical records under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The authorization form provided by the plaintiff's counsel only allowed disclosure to the legal representative and did not permit the healthcare providers to access Mark's medical records from each other, hindering the comprehensive defense preparation. This limitation violates the strict standards set by HIPAA for the release of medical information, which could potentially result in a violation of patient privacy rights.
