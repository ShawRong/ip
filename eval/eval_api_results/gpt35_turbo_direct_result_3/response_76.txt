### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the release of specific information about individual facilities, including names, when it could potentially lead to the identification of individuals involved in health-related matters. The Department's decision to withhold such details was in line with protecting individuals' privacy under HIPAA regulations.
