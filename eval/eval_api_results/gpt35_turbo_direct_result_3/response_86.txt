### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Permits** the actions taken by Linda Cardamone in reaching out for emergency assistance based on her concerns for Martin Bayne's well-being. The rule allows healthcare providers to disclose protected health information without authorization when they believe in good faith that it is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety. In this case, Cardamone's actions were driven by a genuine concern for Bayne's safety, justifying her decision to contact emergency services.
