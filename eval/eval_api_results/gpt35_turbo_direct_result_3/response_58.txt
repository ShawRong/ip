### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the historical practice described in the case where patient advocates had unrestricted access to electronic health information without obtaining signed releases from patients or their legal representatives. The new policy instituted by the DHHR in June 2014, which required such signed releases for accessing patient health records, aligns with the privacy protections mandated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This change aimed to safeguard patient privacy and ensure that access to sensitive health information is granted only with proper authorization, even if it posed challenges to the advocates' ability to perform audits and oversight.
