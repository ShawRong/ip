### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of detailed health plan information, including individual claims experience and the identities of covered dependents, in the case described. The Privacy Rule protects personal health information from unauthorized access and disclosure, and sharing such sensitive details without proper authorization would violate HIPAA regulations.
