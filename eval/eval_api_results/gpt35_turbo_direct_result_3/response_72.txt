### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of Kirsch's blood-alcohol test results to law enforcement without explicit consent, as it was done without a direct request from law enforcement and without Kirsch's permission. While the medical staff believed it was necessary for the investigation, HIPAA regulations prioritize patient privacy and require explicit consent for the sharing of medical information in most cases.
