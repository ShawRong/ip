Based on the provided case and the instructions for assessing compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, let's go through the steps:

### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs and their content in this case involve the consideration of protected health information (PHI) disclosure under specific conditions, including court orders or protective orders. The protective order issued by the court in this case is crucial for defining and controlling the scope of information disclosure to ensure only relevant data is shared.

### Step 2:
Considering the details provided in the case, the disclosure of the plaintiff's protected health information through the proposed ex parte interviews falls within the permissible boundaries of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The court's intervention and issuance of a protective order demonstrate a conscious effort to balance the defendant's need for information with the privacy rights of the plaintiff and his medical providers.

### Step 3:
Therefore, in response to whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case, the answer is **"Permit"**. The court's decision to grant the defendant's request for ex parte interviews under a protective order aligns with the HIPAA regulations by ensuring the confidentiality and limited disclosure of PHI while facilitating the discovery process in the legal dispute.
