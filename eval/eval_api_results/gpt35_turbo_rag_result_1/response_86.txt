Step 1: Checking the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(g)(5)(i)(B)) and their content reveals that this section pertains to the disclosure of protected health information for law enforcement purposes.
  
Step 2: After reviewing the case, it is evident that the actions of the healthcare professionals and law enforcement were taken with the intention of protecting the patient and ensuring his safety. The disclosure of Bayne's information to law enforcement was based on a perceived threat to his well-being.

Step 3: Given the circumstances and the intent behind the actions taken by Cardamone and the responding officers, the case aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would **permit** the disclosure of protected health information in this situation to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.
