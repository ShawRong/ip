### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (160.202, 164.508(a)) and their content:**
    - HIPAA regulation 160.202: This regulation pertains to the general requirements for the adoption of administrative simplification standards.
    - HIPAA regulation 164.508(a): This regulation addresses uses and disclosures for which an authorization is required. 

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
    - The case involving Olsen and Shaw's disclosure of patient information to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for compliance with the Maine Medical Marijuana Act (MMMA) raises concerns regarding the potential violation of HIPAA regulations.
  
3. **Response:** 
    - **Forbid:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally forbids the disclosure of protected health information without explicit patient consent, unless permitted by the law. In this case, the requirement of disclosing patient information to DHHS under Section 10 of the MMMA without patient consent may not align with HIPAA's strict privacy regulations. Olsen and Shaw should seek legal counsel to ensure compliance with both state and federal laws while safeguarding patient confidentiality.
