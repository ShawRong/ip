### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.502(a)(4)(i)) and their content:**
   - HIPAA Regulation 164.502(a)(4)(i) pertains to the permissible uses and disclosures of protected health information for judicial and administrative proceedings. It allows covered entities to disclose PHI in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process, provided certain conditions are met.

2. **Determination of Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - The case involving the disclosure of Christopher J. Bauer's serum-alcohol test results to the Effingham County grand jury raises significant concerns regarding HIPAA compliance.
   - The disclosure of sensitive medical information without explicit patient consent is a critical issue under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Assessment:**  
   - **Permit or Forbid:** Forbid
   - **Reasoning:** The disclosure of Bauer's blood-alcohol test results without his explicit consent to the grand jury for legal purposes does not align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as it breaches patient privacy rights. The disclosure should have been handled in accordance with HIPAA regulations, which require patient authorization for such disclosures, except in specific situations outlined within the law. The grand jury's actions, although aimed at gathering evidence for DUI charges, do not exempt them from complying with HIPAA regulations regarding patient privacy and confidentiality.
