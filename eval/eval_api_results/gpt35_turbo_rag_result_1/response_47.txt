### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(g)(5)(ii)) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA regulation IDs 164.502(g)(5)(ii) pertain to the requirements for uses and disclosures of protected health information for individuals in custody.
  
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits individuals to access their own medical records, with certain exceptions. However, the denial of access in this case appears to be based on the compilation of records in anticipation of legal proceedings, which may fall under permissible restrictions according to HIPAA.

3. **Answer:**
   - **Forbid**

In this case, the denial of access to Dustin J. Merryfield's medical and treatment records appears to align with permissible restrictions under the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the nature of the records being compiled for legal proceedings. Merryfield's request for access may be legitimately denied based on these grounds, indicating that the HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids his access in this particular situation.
