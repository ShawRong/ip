### Response:

#### Step 1:
The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs are 164.510(a)(3)(i) and 164.510(a)(3)(i)(B). These regulations pertain to the permissible disclosures for law enforcement purposes.

#### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it is evident that the actions taken by the hospital, including the blood alcohol level test and the subsequent release of medical records for law enforcement purposes, raise concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

#### Step 3:
The actions described in the case **Forbid** compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of Eichhorst's medical information without her explicit consent for law enforcement purposes, even under the belief of emergency circumstances, may not align with HIPAA regulations. The situation would require further scrutiny and possibly legal intervention to address the potential violations of patient privacy rights outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
