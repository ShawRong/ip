### Response:
1. **Checking HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.508(c)(2),164.508(b)(2)):**
   - Regulation 164.508(c)(2) pertains to the content requirements for an authorization. It specifies that an authorization must contain a description of each purpose of the use or disclosure of the PHI.
   - Regulation 164.508(b)(2) relates to the elements required for a valid authorization. It states that an authorization must include a specific description of the information to be disclosed.
   
2. **Determining Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:**
   - The case involving Lesha Carter and her minor child, Jazyhia Carter, does not comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The authorization forms sent by the Carters lacked crucial elements outlined in the HIPAA regulations, such as specific descriptions of the information to be disclosed, the names of authorized individuals/entities, and the purpose of disclosure.
   
3. **Assessment Result:**
   - The case is **Forbid** in terms of compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The non-compliant authorization forms failed to meet the necessary requirements, preventing lawful access to the plaintiffs' medical records by the healthcare providers.
