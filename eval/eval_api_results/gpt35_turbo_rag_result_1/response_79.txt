Based on the provided case, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

#### Step 1: 
The HIPAA regulation IDs mentioned in the case are as follows:
- 164.510(a)(3)(i)
- 164.510(b)(1)(ii)
- 164.510(b)(1)(i)
- 164.510(a)(3)
- 164.510(a)(3)(i)(A)
- 164.510(b)(4)
- 164.510(a)
- 164.510(b)

These regulations within the HIPAA Privacy Rule outline the standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information.

#### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it seems that the sharing of protected health information (PHI) in this emergency situation aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of PHI to the 911 dispatch service appears to be permissible under the Rule as it was necessary for the provision of emergency medical services.

#### Step 3:
Based on the assessment, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would **permit** the sharing of protected health information in this case.

It's crucial to note that in emergency situations where immediate medical attention is required, the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for the disclosure of PHI to ensure proper care and assistance in line with the individual's best interests and well-being.
