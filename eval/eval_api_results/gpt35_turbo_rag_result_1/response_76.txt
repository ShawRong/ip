The case aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule as the Department, in responding to the public information request, appropriately balanced the public interest in understanding abuse allegations with the need to protect individual privacy. By providing aggregated data while safeguarding specific information that could lead to individual identification, the Department complied with HIPAA regulations by not disclosing protected health information.
