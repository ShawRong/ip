### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule
   - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

2. **Determination:** Permit

The case involving the request for the medical files of the train crew members by the plaintiff does not violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The plaintiff's request is relevant to the lawsuit as it aims to establish the fitness of the train crew members and their role in the tragic incident. Union Pacific's objection citing concerns over privacy laws is understandable; however, in this context, the disclosure of the medical files is justified for the purpose of demonstrating negligence. The balance between discovery in legal proceedings and protecting individual privacy rights leans towards permitting the request in this scenario.
