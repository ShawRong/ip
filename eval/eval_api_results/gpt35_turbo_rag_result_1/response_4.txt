Based on the provided case, let's assess its compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Step 1 - Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.506(c)(1)) and their content**:
   - HIPAA regulation 164.506(c)(1) pertains to the permissible uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI) for covered entities. This section outlines conditions under which PHI can be used or disclosed without the patient's authorization.

2. **Step 2 - Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case**:
   - In this case, the flow of private information within the healthcare ecosystem involves covered entities handling protected health information (PHI) for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. The routine uses described align with the permitted purposes under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Step 3 - Answer (Permit or Forbid)**:
   - **Permit**: The scenario described in the case appears to align with the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The handling and disclosure of protected health information for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations by covered entities without explicit patient consent, but within the framework of HIPAA regulations, are generally permissible.

Overall, based on the information provided, the case seems to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule by balancing the need for efficient healthcare operations with the protection of patient privacy and confidentiality.
