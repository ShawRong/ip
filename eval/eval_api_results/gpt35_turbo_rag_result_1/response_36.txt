### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content:**
   - HIPAA Regulation IDs:
     - HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164)
   - Content: The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information. It applies to health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically.

2. **Determination:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not permit the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without patient consent, except in specific circumstances outlined within the regulation.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - **Forbid**: The disclosure of comprehensive medical information including diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory work, and payment methods without patient consent would likely violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the sensitive nature of the information and the lack of patient authorization. Dr. Zadeh's concerns about patient privacy and potential violations of state and federal privacy regulations are valid in this context.
