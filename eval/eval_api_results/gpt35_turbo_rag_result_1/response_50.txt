Based on the provided case involving Wyeth's legal battle concerning prescription diet drugs Pondimin® and Redux™, the analysis for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule can be conducted as follows:

### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs (160.408(b)(4)) pertain to the permissible uses and disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings. These regulations outline the conditions under which protected health information (PHI) can be disclosed for litigation purposes.

### Step 2:
After reviewing the case details, it is essential to determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the ex parte interviews sought by Wyeth's attorneys with the plaintiffs' treating physicians in North Carolina.

### Step 3:
In this scenario, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely **permit** the ex parte interviews with the plaintiffs' treating physicians under specific safeguards. While patient privacy is paramount, disclosures for litigation purposes, when properly managed, can be permissible under HIPAA regulations for ensuring a fair legal process.

By carefully considering the balance between privacy protections and the requirements of the legal system, including the court's imposition of procedural safeguards, Wyeth's defense strategy in this case seems to align with the HIPAA Privacy Rule's provisions regarding disclosures for judicial proceedings.
