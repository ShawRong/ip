Based on the provided case involving Dr. Roger T. Crenshaw and Dr. Harris, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

### Step 1:
- **HIPAA Regulation ID:** 164.508(a)(2)(i)(A)
- **Content:** This regulation pertains to the permissible uses and disclosures for which an authorization is not required under HIPAA.

### Step 2:
- **Determination:** Considering the scenario described in the case, the action of Defendant’s attorneys contacting Dr. Harris seeking information related to Crenshaw's condition without explicit consent might raise concerns regarding compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

### Step 3:
- **Conclusion:** The action of obtaining medical information without explicit consent from the patient potentially violates the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as patient consent is a fundamental aspect of information disclosure under HIPAA.

Therefore, in this case, the action taken by the Defendant’s attorneys could be deemed as **Forbid** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, given the importance of patient consent and confidentiality in protecting individuals' health information.
