Based on the provided case, we can assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

#### Step 1:
- **HIPAA Regulation IDs:** 164.510(a)(3), 164.502(a)(4)(i)
- **Content:** These regulations govern the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without explicit patient authorization.

#### Step 2:
- **Determination:** Considering the case where hospital personnel disclosed Kirsch's blood-alcohol test results to law enforcement without his consent, we need to evaluate if this disclosure complies with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

#### Step 3:
- **Answer:** The disclosure of Kirsch's blood-alcohol test results without his consent to law enforcement could potentially violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule since it involves the release of sensitive medical information without authorization. However, HIPAA does allow for disclosures without patient authorization in certain circumstances, such as for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. In this case, the disclosure to law enforcement was made under the belief of necessity for an ongoing investigation.

Therefore, the action taken might be considered permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule based on the "permitted" grounds for disclosure related to law enforcement activities in certain situations.
