1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and their content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule
   - HIPAA Statute ยง 164.508

2. **Determination:** Permit

3. **Explanation:** 
   The case involving Glen Murphy's situation in Florida, where he was required to provide written authorization for the release of his protected health information before proceeding with a medical negligence lawsuit, appears to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The authorization form, although mandatory under Florida law, aligns with the federal mandates protecting patient information, as described in the HIPAA regulations. While Murphy expressed concerns about potential privacy breaches due to the disclosure, the legal framework surrounding the authorization aims to balance state requirements with federal privacy standards. Therefore, in this context, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of health information as mandated by the state statute.
