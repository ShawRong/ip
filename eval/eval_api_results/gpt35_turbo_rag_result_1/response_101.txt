### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(j)(1)(ii)) and their content:**
   - The HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(j)(1)(ii)) pertain to permitted uses and disclosures for judicial and administrative proceedings. It allows covered entities to disclose protected health information in response to a court or administrative order, or in response to a subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process. However, the rule specifies certain safeguards that must be in place when such disclosures are made.
   
2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, Denali's repeated requests for medical releases and ex parte communications with Harrold-Jones's healthcare providers raise concerns regarding patient privacy under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Harrold-Jones's refusal to grant such authorizations highlights her desire to protect her medical information and control who has access to it.
   
3. **Answer (Permit or Forbid):**
   - **Forbid**: The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally prohibits ex parte communications between a healthcare provider and a third party without the patient's authorization. In this context, where Denali sought direct communication with Harrold-Jones's healthcare providers without her consent, it goes against the patient's privacy rights as outlined in the HIPAA regulations.

This assessment indicates that the actions taken by Denali in seeking ex parte communications without Harrold-Jones's consent are not in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
