Based on the provided case description, here is an assessment of the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

### Step 1:
The HIPAA regulation IDs and their content need to be checked to assess compliance.

### Step 2:
After reviewing the case, it appears that there were multiple healthcare professionals involved in the care and subsequent legal proceedings of the patient. The disclosure of protected health information about the patient, Arlie Alexander, was involved in the legal strategy and representation of the healthcare professionals in a wrongful death lawsuit.

### Step 3:
In this case, the disclosure of protected health information appears to be necessary for legal proceedings and representation, which may fall under the HIPAA Privacy Rule's provisions for disclosures in judicial settings. As such, based on the information provided, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely **permit** the disclosure of protected health information in this specific scenario for legal purposes.
