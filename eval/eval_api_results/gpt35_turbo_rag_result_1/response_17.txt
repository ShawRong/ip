### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content:**
   - HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164)
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.

2. **Determination:** The case of Marcellus and Anet Maple versus Colonial Orthopaedics, Inc. raises concerns regarding the protection of personal and medical information. The disclosure of highly sensitive data without consent, especially in a public forum like a court filing, poses a significant privacy risk. The actions of Colonial Orthopaedics in submitting the Proof of Claim containing such detailed personal and medical information without the Maples' authorization could potentially violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

3. **Compliance Assessment:** Based on the principles outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the disclosure of personal and medical information without consent might likely be considered a violation. The sensitive nature of the data involved, the lack of consent, and the subsequent emotional distress and embarrassment suffered by the Maples all point to potential non-compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

4. **Conclusion:** In this case, it appears that the actions of Colonial Orthopaedics in disclosing the Maples' private information without consent could be deemed as not compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which emphasizes the importance of protecting individuals' health information and ensuring privacy rights. The court's decision to grant the Maples' motion to restrict public access to the information acknowledges the seriousness of the privacy breach and the need to safeguard such sensitive data.
