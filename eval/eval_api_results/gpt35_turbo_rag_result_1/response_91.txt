### Response:
1. **Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.502(g)(5)(ii)) and their content:**
   - HIPAA regulation 164.502(g)(5)(ii) pertains to the permitted uses and disclosures for psychotherapy notes. These notes are treated with stricter confidentiality requirements compared to other medical records under HIPAA.

2. **Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case:**
   - In this case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule would likely forbid the release of K.B.'s therapy records without proper authorization. The physician's advice and concern for K.B.'s well-being align with the Rule's emphasis on protecting patient privacy and health information.

3. **Answer: Forbid**
   - The disclosure of K.B.'s therapy records without a court order would likely be forbidden under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, considering the sensitive nature of psychotherapy notes and the potential harm to K.B.'s well-being if these records were released without appropriate authorization.
