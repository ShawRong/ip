# Law
160.103(Business%20associate)(3)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Business Associate: A business associate is a person or entity that performs functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Subcontractor: A subcontractor refers to a third party that performs services on behalf of the business associate, specifically in relation to the handling of protected health information.
# Key Legal Principles
Privacy and Security: The law emphasizes the need for safeguarding protected health information by ensuring that both business associates and their subcontractors comply with privacy and security regulations. Accountability: Business associates are held accountable for the actions of their subcontractors, meaning they must ensure that subcontractors adhere to the same standards of protection for PHI.
# Application Scenarios
A business associate hires a subcontractor to manage patient data processing. The subcontractor must comply with HIPAA regulations regarding the handling of PHI. A healthcare provider contracts a billing company as a business associate, which then hires a data storage service as a subcontractor. Both entities must ensure the security of the protected health information.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of subcontractors in the definition of business associates underscores the importance of a chain of responsibility in the protection of PHI throughout all levels of service provision. This provision clarifies that compliance with health information privacy regulations extends beyond the business associate to include any subcontractor involved, thereby reinforcing a comprehensive approach to data protection.
