# Law
160.103(Business%20associate)(4)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
Business Associate: A business associate is typically a person or entity that performs functions on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Covered Entity: This refers to health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction.
# Key Legal Principles
Disclosure of Information: The principle that covered entities can disclose protected health information to business associates under certain conditions, particularly for treatment purposes, provided there are safeguards in place. Treatment Exception: This principle highlights that disclosures made by a covered entity to a health care provider for the purpose of treating the individual do not classify the provider as a business associate.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider receives patient information from a hospital to facilitate patient treatment, falling under the treatment exception. A physician shares relevant patient data with another provider for continuity of care, which is permissible without the need for a business associate agreement.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law clarifies the conditions under which health care providers can receive information from a covered entity without being considered business associates, thus streamlining treatment processes. By delineating the exceptions for health care providers in the context of treatment disclosures, the law supports the overarching goal of ensuring patient care while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.
