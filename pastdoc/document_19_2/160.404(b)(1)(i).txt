# Law
160.404(b)(1)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
Civil money penalties: These are financial penalties imposed by a governmental authority for violations of regulations or laws. They serve as a deterrent against non-compliance. Violation thresholds: The law specifies that penalties cannot exceed a certain amount for each violation, which in this context is set at more than $100.
# Key Legal Principles
Prohibition of excessive penalties: The law ensures that civil money penalties remain within a reasonable limit, promoting fairness and proportionality in enforcement. Temporal application: The law distinguishes between violations based on when they occurred, indicating that penalties are not applicable to actions taken before a certain date.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider commits multiple violations of regulations before February 18, 2009, and the Secretary cannot impose civil money penalties for those actions. A business faces a civil money penalty for violations occurring after February 18, 2009, where the penalties could exceed $100 per violation.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision highlights the legal framework that limits punitive measures, ensuring that penalties are not arbitrarily high and are applied justly. It underscores the importance of the date of violation in determining the applicability of civil penalties, reinforcing the need for compliance awareness among regulated entities.
