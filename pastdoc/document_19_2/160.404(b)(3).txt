# Law
160.404(b)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty**: A financial penalty imposed by a government agency for violations of laws or regulations, meant to deter non-compliance. **Administrative Simplification Provisions**: Regulations aimed at reducing the complexity of healthcare transactions, thereby improving efficiency and compliance.
# Key Legal Principles
**Non-Duplication Principle**: If a violation occurs under two provisions that state the same requirement, only one penalty can be enforced to prevent excessive punishment for the same act. **Proportionality**: The principle that penalties should be proportionate to the violation, ensuring fairness in enforcement.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider inadvertently violates two similar privacy regulations in a single instance, leading to the imposition of a penalty under only one provision. A company faces a civil money penalty for failing to comply with a general requirement that is also detailed in a more specific rule; they are only penalized once for the violation.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision supports a fair enforcement strategy by limiting penalties to avoid multiple punishments for a single violation, enhancing compliance understanding. It emphasizes the importance of clarity in regulations, ensuring that entities are not confused by overlapping requirements, which aids in administrative efficiency.
