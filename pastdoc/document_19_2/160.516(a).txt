# Key Legal Concepts
Discovery: A pre-trial procedure where parties obtain evidence from each other to prepare for litigation. Relevant and Material Evidence: Documents that directly relate to the case and are necessary for the resolution of the issues at hand.
# Key Legal Principles
Right to Request Production: Parties have the legal right to request documents that are pertinent to the case, promoting transparency. Limitations on Discovery: Discovery processes are governed by specific rules that limit the types of requests to ensure they are relevant and not overly burdensome.
# Application Scenarios
A party involved in a case before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) may request specific documents from the opposing party to support their claims or defenses. A lawyer might use this provision to gather evidence that could substantiate a client's position in a dispute.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law establishes the framework for obtaining crucial evidence, which underpins the fairness and thoroughness of the adjudicatory process. It emphasizes the importance of relevant evidence in ensuring that the ALJ can make informed decisions based on complete information.
