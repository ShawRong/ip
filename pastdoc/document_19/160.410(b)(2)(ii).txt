# Law
160.410(b)(2)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entity**: A term referring to organizations or individuals that handle protected health information and are subject to regulations under the law. **Violation**: Refers to a breach of compliance with legal standards, particularly in the context of health information privacy and security. **Reasonable Diligence**: The standard of care that a covered entity is expected to exercise in order to become aware of violations. **Secretary's Discretion**: The authority given to the Secretary to determine additional compliance periods based on specific circumstances.
# Key Legal Principles
**Timeliness of Correction**: The principle that violations should be addressed within a specified timeframe to mitigate penalties. **Knowledge Standard**: The legal expectation that entities must act when they know or should reasonably know about a violation. **Discretion in Enforcement**: The principle that allows for flexibility in determining penalties and compliance periods based on the nature of the violation.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discovers a data breach and must assess when they became aware of the violation to determine their penalty timeline. A health insurance company identifies a compliance failure and seeks to understand the additional time allowed by the Secretary to rectify the issue.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes the importance of proactive compliance measures by covered entities, framing accountability within a timeline that encourages prompt correction. It establishes a balance between enforcing penalties and allowing for corrective actions, which supports a culture of compliance rather than punitive measures alone.
