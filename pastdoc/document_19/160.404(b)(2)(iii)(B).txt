# Law
160.404(b)(2)(iii)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
Willful neglect: This refers to a conscious, intentional disregard for the requirements of the law, indicating a level of culpability that is more severe than mere negligence. Correction period: This specifies a 30-day window in which a covered entity or business associate can rectify a violation after becoming aware of it, potentially mitigating penalties.
# Key Legal Principles
Penalty escalation: The law stipulates significant financial penalties (in excess of $1,500,000) for repeated identical violations within a calendar year, reflecting a strict approach to enforcement against ongoing non-compliance. Encouragement of compliance: The provision aims to incentivize entities to promptly address violations once they are aware, thereby promoting adherence to legal standards.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discovers a breach of patient data due to willful neglect. If they rectify the issue within the 30-day period after becoming aware, they may avoid or reduce penalties. A business associate experiences multiple instances of non-compliance within a year. If these are identified as identical violations, the cumulative penalties can exceed $1,500,000, highlighting the need for rigorous compliance practices.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law underscores the importance of accountability in managing violations, particularly emphasizing the consequences of willful neglect. It serves as a deterrent against repeated violations, reinforcing the legal framework's focus on protecting sensitive information and ensuring compliance among covered entities.
