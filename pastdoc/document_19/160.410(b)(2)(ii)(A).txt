# Law
160.410(b)(2)(ii)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
The 'covered entity' refers to organizations or individuals subject to the law, typically those handling sensitive information. The '30-day period' establishes a timeframe for accountability, determining when penalties can be applied based on a violation's discovery.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of 'reasonable diligence' emphasizes the obligation of entities to actively monitor and ensure compliance. The concept of 'knowledge' indicates that penalties are contingent upon the entity's awareness or reasonable ability to discover the violation.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discovers a data breach and must assess whether they acted with reasonable diligence within the specified 30 days. A business learns of a compliance failure and needs to document when they became aware of the issue to mitigate potential penalties.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law underscores the importance of proactive compliance measures for covered entities, linking their awareness to liability. It reinforces the need for timely corrective actions, influencing how entities manage compliance and respond to violations.
