# Law
160.314(c)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual and is related to their health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care services. **Investigational Inquiries**: Processes initiated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to gather information or evidence related to compliance with health regulations.
# Key Legal Principles
**Confidentiality of PHI**: The law emphasizes the importance of protecting PHI obtained during investigations, limiting disclosures to only those necessary for compliance or as required by law. **Use of Evidence in Proceedings**: The law allows testimony and evidence obtained during investigational inquiries to be utilized in administrative or judicial proceedings, ensuring that HHS can enforce compliance effectively.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider is investigated for potential violations of health regulations, and PHI is collected during the inquiry. This information can be used in subsequent enforcement actions. A patientâ€™s health records are subpoenaed during an investigation, and while the records are generally confidential, they can be disclosed for compliance assessments or legal requirements.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the balance between protecting patient privacy and ensuring that HHS can effectively enforce health regulations by using evidence obtained in investigations. It establishes a framework for how PHI can be handled during inquiries, promoting accountability while adhering to legal standards for confidentiality.
