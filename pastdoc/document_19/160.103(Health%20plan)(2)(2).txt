# Key Legal Concepts
Health plan exclusions: This concept refers to specific services or provisions that are not covered under a health plan, which can impact the availability of care for individuals.

# Key Legal Principles
Public funding for health care: This principle emphasizes the role of government or public entities in providing financial resources to ensure access to health care services. Direct provision of services: This principle focuses on the importance of directly delivering health care to individuals, rather than through intermediaries, to enhance accessibility and effectiveness.
# Application Scenarios
Implementation of a grant program to provide vaccinations in low-income communities. Funding initiatives that support mental health services directly delivered to at-risk populations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The exclusion of certain services under health plans highlights the need for alternative funding mechanisms like grants to ensure comprehensive health care access. The emphasis on direct provision of health care through grants supports the argument for more targeted and effective health interventions in vulnerable communities.
