# Law
160.410(b)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty (CMP)**: A financial penalty imposed by the government on entities that violate laws or regulations. In this context, the Secretary cannot impose a CMP on covered entities for violations prior to February 18, 2009, if certain conditions are met. **Affirmative Defense**: A legal defense that, if proven, mitigates or eliminates liability for a violation. Covered entities can establish an affirmative defense to avoid CMPs for non-compliance.
# Key Legal Principles
**Ordinary Business Care and Prudence**: This principle asserts that covered entities are expected to exercise reasonable care in their business operations. If a violation occurs due to circumstances beyond their control, they may not be penalized if they can demonstrate they acted prudently. **Non-Willful Neglect**: This principle differentiates between negligence that is willful and that which is not. If a violation is not due to willful neglect, the covered entity may be eligible for an affirmative defense.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider fails to meet a compliance requirement due to an unforeseen natural disaster but can demonstrate that they acted with ordinary care to prevent the violation. A business corrects a compliance issue promptly upon discovering it, thereby establishing a basis for an affirmative defense against penalties.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law outlines specific defenses that can protect covered entities from penalties, reinforcing the importance of reasonable business practices and corrective actions. It emphasizes the balance between holding entities accountable for compliance while also acknowledging situations where penalties may be unjust.
