# Law
160.103(Health%20plan)(1)(xii)
# Key Legal Concepts
The term 'health plan' encompasses a range of programs and services that provide health care coverage, which can include government programs, private insurance, and various managed care arrangements. The Indian Health Service (IHS) program is a federal health program specifically designed to provide health services to American Indian and Alaska Native populations, ensuring access to necessary medical care and services.
# Key Legal Principles
Federal recognition of the Indian Health Service as a critical component of health care for Native populations emphasizes the government's obligation to ensure that these communities receive adequate health services. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act establishes the framework for the IHS, detailing its responsibilities, funding mechanisms, and the scope of health services it must provide.
# Application Scenarios
Eligibility for the Indian Health Service program may be assessed for individuals seeking health care services, particularly in tribal areas. Health care providers may refer to this law when designing programs or services targeted at Native populations, ensuring compliance with federal health care standards.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of the Indian Health Service under the definition of 'health plan' highlights the importance of comprehensive health coverage that addresses historical disparities faced by Native communities. This law reinforces the commitment of the federal government to uphold health equity by providing targeted services to underserved populations, thus supporting broader public health goals.
