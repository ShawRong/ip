# Law
164.502(j)(1)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Whistleblower Protections: This law provides protections for whistleblowers, allowing them to disclose protected health information without the covered entity facing violations if the disclosures meet certain criteria. Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any information in a medical record or designated record set that can be used to identify an individual and relates to their health condition, care, or payment for health care. Authorized Disclosure: The law specifies conditions under which disclosures of PHI are permitted, particularly to designated authorities or legal representatives.
# Key Legal Principles
Good Faith Disclosure: The principle that a covered entity is not liable for violations if the disclosure is made in good faith to appropriate authorities. Legal Counsel Privilege: Allows workforce members to disclose information to attorneys for the purpose of seeking legal advice, thus protecting the integrity of the legal process.
# Application Scenarios
A nurse discloses patient information to a health oversight agency regarding suspected malpractice by a physician. A healthcare worker consults an attorney about potential legal implications of witnessing unethical practices in their workplace.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This section reinforces the importance of safeguarding whistleblowers while ensuring that disclosures are made to appropriate entities. It underlines the legal framework that balances the need for confidentiality in healthcare with the necessity of reporting misconduct, thereby promoting ethical standards.
