# Law
164.502(a)(1)(vi)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entities**: Organizations or individuals that provide health care services and transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. They are subject to regulations regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI). **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any information related to an individual's health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual. Regulations govern how this information can be used and disclosed.
# Key Legal Principles
**Permitted Uses and Disclosures**: Covered entities can use or disclose PHI without individual authorization under specific circumstances defined in the regulations, such as for treatment, payment, or health care operations. **Authorization Requirements**: Certain uses and disclosures of PHI require prior written consent from the individual, except in situations explicitly outlined as exempt, such as those described in ยง 164.512.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider may share PHI with a third-party billing company without patient authorization for the purpose of processing claims, as allowed under ยง 164.512. A health plan may use PHI for underwriting purposes, provided it adheres to the limitations regarding genetic information as stated in ยง 164.514(g).
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes the balance between patient privacy and the operational needs of health care entities, ensuring that essential information can be shared while protecting individual rights. It establishes a framework that allows covered entities to operate effectively while remaining compliant with privacy regulations, reinforcing the importance of maintaining confidentiality in health care.
