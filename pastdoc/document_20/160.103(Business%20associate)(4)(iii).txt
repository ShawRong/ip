# Law
160.103(Business%20associate)(4)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Business Associate**: A business associate is defined under HIPAA as a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). However, specific exceptions exist, including government agencies acting under certain legal authorizations. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This term refers to any individually identifiable health information that is held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associates, in any form or medium. The handling of PHI is strictly regulated to ensure privacy and security.
# Key Legal Principles
**Exemption for Government Agencies**: The law specifies that government agencies involved in determining eligibility for government health plans are not considered business associates when collecting PHI for authorized purposes, highlighting a legal principle of public benefit. **Authorization by Law**: The principle that all activities involving PHI must be authorized by law underscores the legal requirement for compliance and ensures that entities engaging in such activities operate within a defined legal framework.
# Application Scenarios
A government agency assessing an individual's eligibility for Medicaid might collect PHI but is exempt from being classified as a business associate because its activities are legally authorized. A state department of health may collect data for public health initiatives without being considered a business associate, provided that such actions are sanctioned by law.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of government agencies in this context supports the argument that public entities can operate within health systems without the same restrictions as business associates, facilitating access to necessary health information for public welfare. By delineating the role of government agencies in health plan eligibility, the law aims to balance the protection of individual privacy with the need for efficient public health administration.
