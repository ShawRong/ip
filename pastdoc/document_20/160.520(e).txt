# Key Legal Concepts
The concept of a subpoena refers to a legal document that orders an individual to appear at a designated time and place to provide testimony or produce evidence in a legal proceeding. The requirement for specificity in a subpoena ensures that the witness knows exactly when and where to appear, as well as what evidence they must bring, which helps to uphold the efficiency and fairness of legal processes.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of due process is upheld by ensuring that witnesses are given clear instructions regarding their obligations, allowing them to prepare adequately for their testimony. The principle of legal certainty is reinforced through the requirement for detailed subpoenas, which minimizes ambiguity and potential disputes about compliance.
# Application Scenarios
A witness receiving a subpoena in a civil trial must understand the exact date and location to avoid penalties for non-compliance. A lawyer preparing a case can issue a subpoena that specifies documents needed from a witness to support their arguments during the hearing.
