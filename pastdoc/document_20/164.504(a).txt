# Law
164.504(a)
# Key Legal Concepts
Plan administration functions: This refers to the administrative tasks performed by the plan sponsor specifically for the group health plan, distinguishing them from tasks related to other benefit plans. Summary health information: This is a type of health information that may include identifiable data but is aggregated in a way that does not reveal individual identities, allowing for certain disclosures without violating privacy protections.
# Key Legal Principles
Organizational requirements: The law establishes requirements for how group health plans must handle and disclose health information, emphasizing the protection of individual privacy. Scope of information handling: It differentiates between the types of information a group health plan may create or receive, establishing that not all plans have the same obligations depending on the information involved.
# Application Scenarios
A health plan sponsor must accurately perform administrative functions related to the health plan to ensure compliance with privacy regulations. A group health plan that only uses summary health information is not required to maintain extensive privacy notices, simplifying operations for certain plans.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The definitions provided in this section set the groundwork for understanding the obligations and limitations placed on group health plans regarding the handling of health information. By clarifying terms like 'plan administration functions' and 'summary health information', the law supports broader regulatory purposes of protecting patient privacy while allowing necessary administrative processes.
