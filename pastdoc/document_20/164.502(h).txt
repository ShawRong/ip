# Law
164.502(h)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted by a covered entity, which includes health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. Confidential Communications: The obligation of health care providers and plans to protect the confidentiality of PHI when communicating it to patients or third parties.
# Key Legal Principles
Minimum Necessary Standard: Covered entities must make reasonable efforts to limit the use and disclosure of PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. Patient Rights: Patients have the right to request restrictions on certain uses and disclosures of their PHI, and covered entities must comply with these requests according to specific guidelines.
# Application Scenarios
A patient requests that their health information not be shared with certain family members; the health care provider must ensure that communications comply with the patient's request. A health plan must ensure that any correspondence sent to a patient regarding their health information is done in a manner that protects the confidentiality required under ยง 164.522(b).
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes the importance of safeguarding patient privacy in health care communications, aligning with the broader goals of the HIPAA regulations. It reinforces the necessity for health care providers and plans to implement policies that ensure compliance with confidentiality obligations, thereby protecting patients' rights and fostering trust.
