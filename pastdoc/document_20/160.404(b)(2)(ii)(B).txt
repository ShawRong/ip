# Law
160.404(b)(2)(ii)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Violation**: A breach of a law or regulation, which in this context refers to non-compliance with certain legal standards. **Reasonable Cause**: A legal standard that implies a violation occurred due to justifiable reasons rather than intentional disregard or neglect. **Willful Neglect**: A more severe standard indicating that a party knowingly failed to comply with legal requirements.
# Key Legal Principles
**Proportionality of Penalties**: The law establishes financial penalties that increase with the severity and frequency of violations, emphasizing accountability. **Mitigating Circumstances**: The recognition of reasonable cause as a factor that can lessen the severity of penalties, differentiating between negligent and intentional actions.
# Application Scenarios
A company may face financial penalties for exceeding $1,500,000 in violations over the year but can argue that such violations were due to reasonable cause to potentially reduce the penalties. An organization that can demonstrate it took reasonable steps to comply with the law, despite resulting violations, may avoid harsher penalties associated with willful neglect.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision highlights the balance between enforcing compliance and recognizing genuine attempts at adherence to the law, which is crucial for fair legal practice. It reinforces the importance of distinguishing between inadvertent and intentional violations, thereby encouraging transparency and accountability in regulatory compliance.
