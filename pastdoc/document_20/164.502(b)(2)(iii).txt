# Law
164.502(b)(2)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Minimum Necessary Standard**: This concept refers to the principle that covered entities must limit the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) to the minimum necessary to achieve the intended purpose. However, the law specifies that this requirement does not apply in certain situations, such as when disclosures are made under an authorization. **Authorization Requirement**: Under § 164.508, an authorization is a formal permission from the patient allowing the covered entity to use or disclose their PHI for purposes other than treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. This ensures that individuals have control over their personal health information.
# Key Legal Principles
**Informed Consent**: The principle of informed consent is integral to the authorization process. Patients must be fully informed about what information will be shared, with whom, and for what purposes, prior to granting permission. **Patient Rights**: The law emphasizes patient rights regarding their health information, including the right to authorize or deny the release of their PHI, which is crucial for maintaining patient autonomy and trust in healthcare systems.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider seeks to share a patient’s medical records with a research institution for a study. The provider must obtain the patient's written authorization under § 164.508 before disclosing any information, as this is not a standard treatment or payment situation. A patient wishes to allow their healthcare provider to disclose their information to a family member for caregiving purposes. The provider must ensure that the patient provides an explicit authorization for this disclosure to comply with legal requirements.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of § 164.502(b)(2)(iii) within the broader regulatory framework highlights the importance of patient control over health information disclosures, reinforcing the notion that although the minimum necessary standard applies generally, specific exceptions exist to empower patient choice through authorized disclosures. This law serves to clarify scenarios where the minimum necessary standard does not apply, emphasizing the balance between protecting patient privacy and permitting necessary information sharing for authorized purposes, thus supporting the overall objective of the legal framework to safeguard patient health information while facilitating appropriate disclosures.
