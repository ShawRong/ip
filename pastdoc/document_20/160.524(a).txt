# Key Legal Concepts
Filing Requirements: This concept emphasizes that certain procedural standards must be met when submitting documents to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Specifically, parties must submit an original document along with two copies unless instructed otherwise. Document Identification: Every document must have a clear caption that includes the title of the action, case number, and a designation of the filed paper. This facilitates organization and clarity in legal proceedings. Signature and Contact Information: The law mandates that all filings must be signed and should include the address and telephone number of the filing party or their representative, ensuring accountability and traceability. Filing by Mail: The law specifies that documents are considered filed when they are mailed, establishing a clear timeline for submissions and legal deadlines.
# Key Legal Principles
Due Process: Proper filing procedures support the principle of due process by ensuring that all parties receive proper notice of actions and can respond appropriately. Clarity and Organization in Legal Proceedings: The requirement for specific formatting and identification of documents enhances the efficiency and organization of legal processes, aiding judges and parties in managing cases. Accountability: By requiring signatures and contact details, the law promotes accountability among parties involved in legal proceedings.
# Application Scenarios
A party wishing to submit a motion to dismiss must ensure that they follow the filing requirements, including submitting the correct number of copies and including the required information in the caption. An attorney representing a client must ensure that all documents filed in a case are signed and contain the necessary contact information, as failure to do so could lead to delays or dismissals.
