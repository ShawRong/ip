# Law
160.404(b)(2)(iv)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
Willful neglect: This refers to a situation where a covered entity or business associate knowingly fails to comply with legal requirements, indicating a level of intentional disregard for the law. Corrective action period: A defined time frame (30 days) within which a violator must correct a known violation to avoid increased penalties.
# Key Legal Principles
Penalty escalation: The law stipulates that penalties can significantly increase when violations are not corrected within the specified time frame, reflecting the seriousness of willful neglect. Aggregation of violations: The law allows for penalties to be cumulative for identical violations occurring within a calendar year, emphasizing accountability for repeated non-compliance.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare organization fails to address repeated data privacy violations that it was aware of for over 30 days, leading to penalties exceeding $1,500,000. A business associate neglects to implement required security measures after being informed of deficiencies, resulting in multiple identical violations over the year.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The stipulation for high penalties reinforces the importance of compliance and timely corrective actions, serving as a deterrent against negligence. By highlighting the consequences of willful neglect, the law underlines the responsibility of entities to proactively manage compliance to protect patient information and avoid hefty fines.
