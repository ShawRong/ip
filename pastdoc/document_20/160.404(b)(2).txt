# Law
160.404(b)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty**: A financial penalty imposed for violations of specific regulations, intended to ensure compliance and deter future violations. **Covered Entity**: Refers to health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that transmit health information electronically. **Business Associate**: A person or entity that performs services for a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information.
# Key Legal Principles
**Reasonable Diligence**: A standard that requires entities to take appropriate steps to understand and comply with laws and regulations applicable to their operations. **Willful Neglect**: A more severe classification of violations, indicating a conscious disregard for compliance obligations. **Corrective Action**: The requirement that entities rectify violations within a specified timeframe to mitigate penalties.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider discovers a data breach but did not know, and could not reasonably have known, about the breach, potentially mitigating penalties. A business associate fails to comply with data protection regulations due to reasonable cause, which may result in a lower penalty than if the violation was due to willful neglect.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions outline how penalties are structured based on the nature of the violation, emphasizing a tiered approach to enforcement. By distinguishing between levels of neglect and corrective action, the law seeks to encourage compliance and prompt remediation of violations.
