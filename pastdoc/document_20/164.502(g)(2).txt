# Law
164.502(g)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Personal Representative**: This concept refers to an individual who has the legal authority to make healthcare decisions on behalf of another person, specifically adults or emancipated minors, as defined by applicable law. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. The law requires covered entities to safeguard this information. **Emancipated Minors**: These are minors who have been legally granted independence from their parents or guardians, thereby gaining the right to make their own healthcare decisions.
# Key Legal Principles
**Authority to Act**: The principle that individuals recognized by law as having the authority to represent others in health care matters must be acknowledged and treated accordingly by covered entities. **Confidentiality Obligations**: Covered entities are required to maintain the confidentiality of PHI, ensuring that personal representatives have access only to relevant information necessary for their decision-making. **Legal Compliance**: This principle emphasizes the necessity for covered entities to understand and comply with applicable laws regarding personal representatives and health care decision-making.
# Application Scenarios
A parent acting on behalf of an emancipated minor who requires medical treatment, where the minor has the legal right to consent but the parent assists in the decision-making process. A legal guardian making health care decisions for an adult with a cognitive impairment, where the guardian is treated as the personal representative with respect to the individual's PHI.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law reinforces the importance of respecting the legal authority of individuals acting on behalf of others in healthcare contexts, ensuring that proper access to PHI is granted to facilitate informed decision-making. It underscores the commitment of covered entities to comply with legal standards that protect patient privacy while allowing necessary access to information for those authorized to act as personal representatives.
