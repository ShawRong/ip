# Law
164.500(b)(1)(v)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any health information that can be used to identify an individual and is held or transmitted by a covered entity or business associate. Business Associate: A person or entity that performs functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of PHI. Uses and Disclosures: The terms refer to how PHI can be utilized or shared. Section 164.512 outlines specific scenarios where authorization from the individual is not required.
# Key Legal Principles
Compliance Obligation: Health care clearinghouses must adhere to the terms of their business associate contracts regarding PHI, ensuring that any handling of the information aligns with those agreements. Authorization Exemptions: Covered entities can use or disclose PHI without individual authorization in specific situations as defined under ยง 164.512, but this does not extend to business associates beyond what is permitted by contract.
# Application Scenarios
A health care clearinghouse processes billing information for a provider under a business associate agreement, ensuring all uses of PHI comply with the contract. A covered entity shares patient data with a clearinghouse for processing, relying on ยง 164.512 to avoid needing individual consent, while the clearinghouse must operate strictly within the contract's terms.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law clarifies the limitations on how clearinghouses can handle PHI, reinforcing the need for contracts to govern these interactions. It emphasizes the balance between facilitating necessary health information exchanges and protecting individual privacy rights.
