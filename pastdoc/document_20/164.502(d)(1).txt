# Law
164.502(d)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
De-identified Information: This refers to health information that has been stripped of identifiers that can be used to trace back to an individual, ensuring that the data cannot be used to identify any person. Covered Entities: These are organizations that are subject to HIPAA regulations, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, which handle protected health information.
# Key Legal Principles
Permissible Uses and Disclosures: The law allows covered entities to use and disclose protected health information to create de-identified information, ensuring that such data is not linked to any individual. Business Associate Agreements: When disclosing protected health information to a business associate for the purpose of creating de-identified data, covered entities must ensure that appropriate agreements are in place to protect patient privacy.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may use patient data to generate aggregated health statistics that do not identify individual patients, thus complying with HIPAA regulations. A research organization may receive de-identified data from a hospital to conduct studies without risking breaches of patient confidentiality.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision supports the broader goals of HIPAA to protect patient privacy while allowing for the beneficial use of health data in research and policy-making. It emphasizes the balance between the need for health information for analysis and the necessity of maintaining patient confidentiality.
