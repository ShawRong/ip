# Law
164.502(a)(5)(i)(A)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
The concept of pre-existing condition exclusions refers to a provision in health insurance plans that limits coverage for health issues that existed before the policy was initiated. This means that if an individual had a medical condition before obtaining insurance, the insurer may deny coverage for treatment of that condition. The reference to 'application' suggests that there are specific criteria or guidelines on how pre-existing conditions are evaluated and excluded from coverage under a given plan.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of non-discrimination in health insurance requires that individuals cannot be unfairly denied coverage based on their medical history, ensuring that pre-existing conditions are treated fairly under the law. The principle of transparency in insurance policies mandates that insurers clearly communicate their terms regarding pre-existing conditions to consumers, allowing individuals to make informed choices about their health coverage.
