# Law
160.516(e)(2)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)**: A neutral party who oversees administrative hearings and makes decisions on motions and disputes. **Protective Order**: A legal order to limit access to certain evidence or information during discovery to protect a party from harassment or undue burden. **Discovery**: The pre-trial phase in a lawsuit where parties exchange information and evidence relevant to the case.
# Key Legal Principles
**Relevance**: The principle that evidence must be related to the claims or defenses in a case to be admissible during discovery. **Discretion of the ALJ**: The ALJ has the authority to grant or deny motions based on their assessment of relevance and the potential impact on the parties involved.
# Application Scenarios
A party requests documents that they believe will support their claims, but the ALJ finds those documents irrelevant to the case at hand. A party files for a protective order to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information that is not pertinent to the proceedings.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes the importance of relevance in the discovery process, reinforcing the ALJ's role in ensuring that only pertinent evidence is considered. It underscores the balance between a party's right to discovery and the need to protect parties from irrelevant or burdensome requests.
