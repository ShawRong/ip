The principle of due process, ensuring that entities have a fair opportunity to address any penalties that may impact their financial health.
# Application Scenarios
Assessing whether a healthcare provider facing penalties can still afford to deliver necessary services to patients. Evaluating the financial implications for a business associate when civil penalties are applied and their potential impact on contractual obligations.
