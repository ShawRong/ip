# Law
160.410(c)(2)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
The Secretary's Discretion: This concept involves the authority granted to the Secretary to determine the appropriateness of extending compliance periods based on specific circumstances. Compliance Failure: This refers to situations where an entity does not meet established regulatory requirements, prompting the need for consideration of extensions.
# Key Legal Principles
Proportionality: The principle that the response (in this case, granting an extension) should be proportionate to the nature and extent of the failure to comply. Discretionary Authority: This principle emphasizes that the Secretary has the power to make decisions regarding extensions based on individual cases, which cannot be easily challenged.
# Application Scenarios
An organization fails to meet a deadline for submitting required documentation and seeks an extension, which the Secretary evaluates based on the specifics of the failure. An entity facing unexpected challenges (e.g., natural disasters) that hinder compliance may request an extension, prompting the Secretary to assess the situation.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision emphasizes the importance of flexibility in regulatory compliance, allowing for tailored responses to unique situations. It illustrates the balance between enforcing regulations and accommodating genuine compliance difficulties, reinforcing the Secretary's role in overseeing adherence.
