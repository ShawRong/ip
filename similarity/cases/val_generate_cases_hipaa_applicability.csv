Agent West knew that such lights commonly are used by private individuals for growing marijuana indoors. His investigation revealed that Robinson had ordered similar lights and hydroponic equipment in 1989 and 1990.Additionally, subpoenaed utility records showed that Robinson’s average kilowatt consumption of 5,570 hours and average utility statement of $410.89 for the months of June, July and August, 1991, had increased to nearly 10,000 kilowatt hours for December, 1991, and a utility statement of $562.00. Houses approximately the size of Robinson’s generated monthly power statements between $130.00 and $150.00. Agent West’s investigation of Robinson’s financial status showed that Robinson owned an attractive house of approximately 2,800 square feet with a swimming pool and a nearby lot containing a new, prefabricated metal building. Although Robinson paid for the high-pressure, sodium lights with a cashier’s check in excess of $7,000.00, Agent West found that the Alabama Department of Revenue had no record of Robinson’s having filed income tax returns.After collecting this information, Agent West directed a helicopter crew to conduct a Forward Looking Infrared Receiver (“FLIR”), thermal imaging examination to compare the heat emanating from Robinson’s house with the intensity of the heat from surrounding objects. Robinson’s home was considerably warmer than surrounding houses. Listing his investigatory findings, Agent West applied for a search warrant of Robinson’s home. On January 31, 1992, Agent West and others executed the search warrant and found a major, indoor marijuana growing operation. Two revolvers, a shotgun, and a rifle also were found near the marijuana cultivation in Robinson’s house.A two-count indictment in the Middle District of Alabama charged Robinson with the manufacture and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and with possession of firearms in connection with a drug trafficking crime. Robinson moved to suppress the marijuana seized from his home pursuant to the search warrant. Following a suppression hearing, the district court denied his motion. Robinson then pled guilty and was sentenced to serve 130 months of imprisonment followed by seven years of supervised release. On appeal, he contends that the FLIR search of his house constituted an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment, and that there were insufficient facts for probable cause to issue the warrant to search his house.","{'Sender': 'DEA Agent', 'Sender Role': 'Law Enforcement', 'Recipient': 'Agent Charles West', 'Recipient Role': 'Law Enforcement', 'About': 'Theodore Robinson, Sr.', 'About Role': 'Defendant', 'Type': 'Financial and Utility Information', 'Purpose': 'Investigating possible drug-related activities', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': ""There is probable cause to search Robinson's home for marijuana and firearms.""}"

See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 221. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for violation of their rights under the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Upon the defendants’ motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), see Docket No. 31, on October 21, 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice for failure to present a substantial federal question. See Docket No. 57 at page 11. Judgment was entered on that same date. See Docket No. 58. An appeal ensued. See Docket No. 59.While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided Obergefell v. Hodges, — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 192 L.Ed.2d 609 (2015), ruling on the issue of same-sex marriage under the Constitution. There, the Court concluded that under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment same-sex couples may not be deprived of the fundamental right to marry. See id. at 2604-2605. Thus, the marriage laws of the States of Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee challenged by the petitioners in the consolidated cases reviewed by the Court were held invalid. See id. at 2605.On July 8, 2015, twelve days after the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling, the First Circuit vacated this court’s judgment and remanded the case “for further consideration in light of Obergefell v. Hodges.” See Docket No. 62 (citation omitted). In doing so, the First Circuit expressed that it “agree[s] with the parties’ joint position that the ban is unconstitutional.” Id.

See Docket Nos. 64 and and 64-1. The parties also seek injunctive relief against the enforcement of Article 68 and any other law denying same-sex couples the right to marry.

McCarson answered the door wearing boxer undershorts and a t-shirt and holding an infant in his arms. The Marshals, who recognized him from a photograph, directed McCarson to sit at the kitchen table, which he did, and conducted a protective sweep of the two-bedroom apartment, in the course of which they discovered nothing of concern. In preparation for his arrest, McCarson made a telephone call to ensure that somebody would take custody of the child and said he wanted to wear his black pants, coat, and shoes, which were in one of the bedrooms. A Marshal told McCarson to remain seated, and two other Marshals went into the bedroom to get those articles. In the process of retrieving them, one of the Marshals noticed marijuana in an open drawer of a dresser inches away from him and then saw an automatic handgun in another drawer, which was also ajar; the latter drawer also contained crack cocaine, which the district court found to have been in plain sight either from the outset or once the Marshals removed the gun.","{'Sender': 'U.S. Marshals', 'Sender Role': 'Law enforcement', 'Recipient': 'McCarson', 'Recipient Role': 'Suspect', 'About': 'McCarson', 'About Role': 'Suspect', 'Type': 'Drug and weapon information', 'Purpose': 'Arrest and prosecution', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Suspect is in possession of illegal drugs and weapons'}"

On May 24, 1993, plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and alleged that the defendant, Graveley Roofing Enterprises, Inc. (“Graveley Roofing”), failed to remit monthly benefit contributions as required by the pertinent collective bargaining agreements. On February 4, 1994, this Court entered an order granting Summary Judgment in favor of each Plaintiff against Defendant. The Order directed Defendant to make available its payroll books and records to determine the amount of delinquent contributions due to Plaintiffs.On June 24, 1994, Plaintiffs conducted the deposition of Michael Graveley, the president of Graveley Roofing. Mr. Graveley testified that Graveley Roofing had subcontracted work to Jackel Services Corporation (“Jackel”), one of the movants here. The collective bargaining agreements prohibit the subcontracting of work to a non-union company. As a result, Plaintiffs assert, and Defendants do not otherwise contend, that Plaintiffs are entitled to contributions from Graveley Roofers for work performed by union members on behalf of Jackel. Plaintiffs attempted to obtain information from Defendant regarding the subcontracting of work to Jackel on two occasions. Finally, at a civil contempt hearing on October 3,1994, Defendant provided a list of documents in its possession, but the list did not contain information regarding contracts or payroll concerning the projects subcontracted to Jackel.Since Graveley Roofing failed to produce records evidencing contracts with Jackel, Plaintiff served the movant, Kathryn A. Graveley, the secretary of Jackel Services, with a subpoena on December 5,1994. The subpoena commanded her to appear for a deposition and directed her to produce any documents in Jacket’s possession, including business records, contracts, payroll records, and tax forms reflecting work received by or subcontracted to Jackel from Graveley Roofing. The subpoena directed Ms. Graveley to appear on January 12, 1995.Rather than comply with the subpoena, the movants filed this 'Motion to Quash the Subpoena on January 11,1995, raising four arguments to support their Motion. The movants first contend that the subpoena imposes an undue burden and expense. Second, the movants claim that the subpoena requests disclosure of confidential communications and irrelevant records.

During that time period, Judge Mu-kasey was under the 24-hour a day protection of the Marshals Service due to threats against his personal safety stemming from his judicial role in handling terrorism cases. The Complaint alleges that the Marshals Service erected sidewalk and street barricades, closed off formerly public parking spaces, set up security cameras, and posted “multiple teams” of armed deputy marshals in the vicinity of Judge Mukasey’s home. (Complaint ¶¶ 6, 27-28).Plaintiffs allege that this security detail constituted an “intrusive presence” that disrupted then- use and enjoyment of their home. (Complaint ¶¶ 5-7, 29). Specifically, Plaintiffs complain that the sidewalk barricades made it difficult for them to enter and leave their home; that they had to identify themselves to Marshals to get access to their home; that they had to ask Marshals to move barricades to unload items from their car; that Marshals Service employees congregated on their front door stoop and increased noise levels by talking loudly and running car motors; that the Marshals Service set up cameras around Judge Mukasey’s home that also filmed parts of Plaintiffs’ property; and that the constant presence of Marshals Service employees frightened Plaintiffs’ minor children. (Complaint ¶¶ 6-7, 27-28, 31-33).In addition, Plaintiffs dispute the effectiveness of the protective services. The Complaint alleges that the Marshals Service’s security operation “was not likely to be pervasive enough to protect the Judge or his neighbors,” and that anyone seeking to attack Judge Mukasey still had “prime access... to circumvent the Marshal’s presence.” (Complaint ¶ 30).In an effort to remedy the situation, Plaintiffs sent correspondence to every elected and appointed official perceived as being in a position to affect the Marshal’s conduct, including the President of the United States, Senators, City Councilmen, and Parking officials. In addition, Plaintiffs sent several letters to the Marshals Service directly, requesting non-monetary relief.On January 12, 2002, the Callahans’s attorney sent a letter to the Marshals Service with an attached draft complaint, stating that they intended to file the complaint “in substantially similar form within the week” if they were unable “to resolve issues of my clients’ safety and property rights.” (Ex. A, Caro Declaration). In response to the January 14, 2002 letter, the United States Attorney’s office sent correspondence stating that because of the highly sensitive information included in the draft Complaint, the Callahans “should not file the draft complaint in its current form or disseminate it in any way”. (Ex. B, Caro Declaration). The United States Attorney’s office suggested meeting with the Callahans to address their concerns.

,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Plaintiffs filed this action under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, (“FOIA”), concerning two FOIA requests made by plaintiff Juan O. Tamayo, a reporter for the Miami Herald. The records requested by plaintiff Tamayo under the FOIA were specific non-public records pertaining to Alberto Coll, whom plaintiff identified in his requests as a department chairman at the U.S. Naval War College. Coll pled guilty in 2005 to charges that he made knowingly false statements to government officials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Plaintiff Tamayo requested records of an admission allegedly signed by Coll at a Navy facility in late 2003 or early 2004 and other documents, statements, electronic surveillance logs, electronic intercepts, audio and video data and any other intercepts gathered as a result of the investigation of Coll. Plaintiff generally requested any documents or materials in the Department of Justice’s or the Navy’s possession that were not contained in the court file related to the Coil’s criminal prosecution.The Department of Justice and the Navy denied Plaintiffs FOIA requests based upon claims of exemption under FOIA for law enforcement and privacy reasons. Plaintiffs administrative appeals of those decisions were also denied. Plaintiff Tamayo and the Miami Herald then filed the pending action under the statute seeking to compel production of the requested documents from the Department of Justice and the Navy.Following the filing of the action, but before the parties’ summary judgment motions were filed or responded to, Plaintiffs served thirteen requests for admission on the Defendants that request the Defendants admit that Coll pled guilty to the federal criminal charges, that he was convicted and sentenced for the charges, that he held specific government positions, that specific documents related to this action or the Coll prosecution be authenticated, and that the government was in fact in possession of documents responsive to the FOIA request at issue.The Defendants objected to all the requests for admissions and did not provide any responsive information. Plaintiffs complied with the Court’s Discovery Procedures Order and requested that the Court review this matter and compel answers to the admissions requests. The Defendants stand by their initial objections to the requests based upon the limited nature of this FOIA proceeding, arguing that FOIA actions are generally resolved on motions for summary judgment without additional discovery. Defendants do not contend that the admissions requests are onerous or burdensome, but instead rely upon the application of the general rule that forecloses such discovery in a FOIA action, at least without an additional showing following the filing of the summary judgment papers that some discovery is necessary for the Court to make its determination.","{'Sender': 'Plaintiffs', 'Sender Role': 'Reporter for the Miami Herald', 'Recipient': 'Department of Justice and Navy', 'Recipient Role': 'Government agencies', 'About': 'Alberto Coll', 'About Role': 'Department chairman at the U.S. Naval War College', 'Type': 'Non-public records, admission allegedly signed by Coll, documents, statements, electronic surveillance logs, electronic intercepts, audio and video data, and any other intercepts gathered as a result of the investigation of Coll', 'Purpose': 'Freedom of Information Act request', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

Having considered defendant’s moving papers, the opposition thereto, and the record, the Court hereby GRANTS defendant’s motion.By this action plaintiffs Darryl and Patricia Sanders seek damages for libel, slander, invasion of privacy, and infliction of emotional distress. The factual background of the case is largely undisputed. The action grew out of two allegedly defamatory statements concerning plaintiff Patricia Sanders’ physical condition.Defendant Erlene Douglas and plaintiff Patricia Sanders are employed by the United States Postal Service at the Torrance, California Post Office. Defendant was the Acting Supervisor of Collections and Delivery at the time of the events in question. Plaintiff was employed in a clerical position and was not under defendant’s direct supervision. On the morning of July 6, 1981, defendant allegedly noticed bruises on the side of plaintiff’s face. Douglas subsequently informed plaintiff’s direct supervisor, Pauline Palmer, of what she had seen.Sometime thereafter plaintiff filed a Worker’s Compensation claim with the Postal Service, alleging that she had injured her back on the job on or about July 7,1981.On July 27, 1981, after the filing of the Worker’s Compensation claim, defendant submitted the following written statement regarding her July 6 observation of Sanders’ physical condition: “On Monday, July 6, 1981, Patricia Sanders reported to work and I noticed that she had bruises on her face and appeared to have been beaten.”On November 16, 1981, Patricia Sanders and her husband Darryl Sanders filed this action in Los Angeles Municipal Court, alleging that defendant’s oral and written statements were defamatory. Plaintiffs contend that defendant’s statements were false and that they exposed plaintiffs to “hatred, contempt, ridicule, and obloquy.” Darryl Sanders claims that the statements made him appear to be a wife-beater or ruffian. Patricia Sanders contends that the written statement implied that she had tried to defraud the United States government by representing that injuries suffered in a wife-beating incident were actually work-related.The action was removed to this Court on December 18, 1981. In the motion now before the Court, defendant seeks summary judgment on all of plaintiffs’ claims. Defendant contends that she is absolutely immune from liability because the actions in question were within the scope of her employment as a government employee. Plaintiffs argue that defendant is not absolutely immune from liability because she acted voluntarily and beyond the scope of her authority.The sole issue before the Court is whether defendant was acting within the scope of her official duty when she made the statements in question.

The Court, while making no findings, accepts these facts as true for purposes of this ruling.Digital Sin contracted “Copyright Enforcement Group” (“CEG”), a company that discovers copyright infringements and arranges for enforcement (Nieolini Dec. ¶3). CEG determined that a number of individuals were sharing the Motion Picture using an internet protocol called BitTorrent. (Comp. ¶¶ 12; Nieolini Dec. ¶¶ 917). BitTorrent software allows users to join together in a “peer-to-peer” network to download and make available for download large files, (Nieolini Dee. ¶¶ 5-7). The individual downloaded might only download small pieces of the file at a time and it may take several days or even weeks for an individual to download an entire file. (1/17/12 Tr. at 10). While downloading, the downloader is also required to share with others the pieces of the file that she or he has already successfully downloaded. (Id. at 13-14). This group of interacting users is referred to as a “swarm.” (Nieolini Dec. ¶ 6).Individuals who participate in a swarm expose the IP address they are using when downloading or sharing a file. (Comp. ¶ 12). As a result, CEG was able to obtain 176 IP addresses that were being used to share and download the same Motion Picture file without permission. (Id.). Publicly available “reverse IP” checks confirmed that all of these addresses very likely belong to individuals located in New York. (Comp. ¶ 14).Immediately after initiating its complaint against the 176 John Doe defendants, identifying them by their IP addresses, Digital Sin filed an ex parte motion for expedited discovery seeking access to the names and addresses of the individuals affiliated with the IP addresses as found in the ISPs’ account records.

During this investigation, the Wage Hour Division Compliance Officer obtained statements and information from Ms. Lagueux and other employees. The employees, including Ms. Lagueux, were assured that their identities would be held in confidence with respect to the information they provided to the Compliance Officer.The Wage and Hour Division subsequently determined that the complaint did not raise issues calling for enforcement proceedings. The Department closed the file on the complaint. Several months later, on October 28, 1981, Ms. Lagueux filed a complaint in the Federal District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging, inter alia, that Interstate Motor Freight System violated the Fair Labor Standards Act.Apparently in the process of defending the lawsuit, plaintiff filed a request with the Department of Labor seeking the entire DOL file created during the investigation into the initial complaint. The Department has complied with the request, but has withheld certain documents. Specifically, the Department has withheld the Employment Information Form and Personal Interview Statement of Donna Lagueux and the name, address and other identifying information that DOL deleted from the Employee Personal Interview Statements of other employees. The Department relied on exemption 7(D) of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D), which provides that:“(b) This section does not apply to matters that are—(7) investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes but only to the extent that the production of such records would(D) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source.”In the Government’s memorandum, it also cites exemption 7(C), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C), claiming that disclosure would “constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” and therefore is excused. However, the Deputy Associate Solicitor from the Department of Labor relied only upon exemption 7(D) in denying the requests and withholding the documents.Upon receiving the letter denying the request, plaintiff filed this lawsuit in which it seeks, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), an order of this court directing the agency and the individual defendants to permit access to the requested documents that have been withheld.","{'Sender': 'Plaintiff', 'Sender Role': 'Michigan corporation', 'Recipient': 'Department of Labor', 'Recipient Role': 'Government agency', 'About': 'Donna Lagueux and other employees', 'About Role': 'Employees of plaintiff', 'Type': 'Employment information and personal interview statements', 'Purpose': 'Request for access to documents withheld by the Department of Labor', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'None'}"

As part of this investigation, Erath obtained a search warrant for a “three-story unattached office building” owned by Meredith in Sunset Beach, California. Erath believed and signs on the property indicated that the building was the headquarters of “We the People.”Pursuant to the search warrant, Erath and twelve other IRS agents entered the Sunset Beach property on July 10,1998, to search for evidence. Upon entering the third floor, Erath and some of the other agents encountered Bybee, who, unbeknownst to them, was using that floor as her residence. According to Bybee, she loudly told the agents that the search was illegal and asked Erath to see a search warrant. Erath did not provide her with the warrant, because it had been left in the car.Bybee alleges that when she repeated her request to see a search warrant Erath grabbed her by her arms, forcibly threw her to the ground and, twisting her arms, placed handcuffs on her wrists. She further alleges that the handcuffs were closed around her wrists so tightly that they caused her pain, and that she suffered extensive bruising by the force used against her.After placing the handcuffs on Bybee, Erath made her sit on a nearby couch, and the search proceeded. Bybee states that she complained several times that the handcuffs were too tight and were causing her pain, but for 30 minutes they were left as they were; thereafter, they were loosened so that they would not cause pain, but would nonetheless restrain her.

Simultaneously, Respondent also froze the four accounts as instructed by Frost Bank, thereby cutting off Appellants’ use and access to the accounts.Of the four accounts that were identified and frozen by Respondent, one was owned by Thomas Howard individually, one by Thomas Howard and Janice Howard jointly, one by Howard Investments, LLC, and one by Thomas Howard and Janice Howard in their capacity as joint owners of Howard Investments, LLC (the three accounts not owned by Thomas Howard individually will be collectively referred to as “the three accounts”). Respondent froze the three accounts for approximately ten days. The value of the three accounts at the time of freezing was in excess of $3 million.Appellants notified Frost Bank and Respondent that they considered the freezing of the three accounts and their disclosure to the trial court in the garnishment action improper, because Frost Bank’s judgment was only against Thomas Howard individually. Soon thereafter, Appellants filed a petition against Frost Bank and Respondent, alleging claims for negligence, wrongful garnishment, and wrongful disclosure. Appellants settled their claims against Frost Bank, which is no longer a party to this action. On May 15, 2014, the trial court granted Respondent’s motion to dismiss Appellants’ amended petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This appeal followed.","{'Sender': 'Frost Bank', 'Sender Role': 'Creditor', 'Recipient': 'Respondent', 'Recipient Role': 'Garnishee', 'About': 'Thomas Howard, Janice Howard, Howard Investments, LLC', 'About Role': 'Debtors, Owners', 'Type': 'Financial account information', 'Purpose': 'Collecting a judgment', 'In Reply To': 'None', 'Consented By': 'None', 'Belief': 'Frost Bank has the legal right to garnish the accounts of the debtor to collect the judgment owed.'}"
,,[],[],Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Chung, a Taiwanese businessman and a favorite of political fundraisers, pleaded guilty in 1998 to making illegal campaign contributions to the Democratic Party. Hoping for a reduced sentence, Chung agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in a broader investigation into violations of the federal election laws by agents of the Chinese government. But Chung’s involvement in that supposedly secret probe was stymied by reports in the press. First The New York Times revealed that Chung was assisting prosecutors and had fingered a Chinese military man as the source of campaign contributions to the Democrats — a leak that caused the FBI to spirit Chung and his family into hiding. Then NBC News reported that Chung was “somewhere in California, worried about retaliation from the Chinese military.” Chung claims the leaks prompted the Chinese government to send “hit squads” after him and his family.Chung filed suit against the Department of Justice and five unnamed “high-ranking DOJ officials,” accusing the defendants of leaking the information in the Times article and the NBC report. He sought damages under the Privacy Act and under the Constitution of the United States. In the ruling under review, the district court granted the Government’s motion to dismiss, finding that Chung’s Privacy Act claim was time-barred and that, because the Privacy Act provides a comprehensive remedial scheme for harm caused by governmental disclosure of personal information, it was inappropriate for a court to imply a constitutional remedy for such disclosure under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Chung appeals both aspects of the district court’s ruling, but only our resolution of his Privacy Act issue merits treatment in a published opinion.","{'Sender': 'The Department of Justice and five unnamed high-ranking officials.', 'Sender Role': 'Government officials.', 'Recipient': 'The public through media outlets.', 'Recipient Role': 'N/A.', 'About': 'Chung, a Taiwanese businessman.', 'About Role': 'N/A.', 'Type': ""Personal information related to Chung's cooperation in a federal investigation."", 'Purpose': 'The purpose of the leaks is not specified.', 'In Reply To': 'N/A.', 'Consented By': 'Chung did not consent to the disclosure of his cooperation.', 'Belief': 'N/A.'}"
