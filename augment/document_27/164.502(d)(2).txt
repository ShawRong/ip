# Law
164.502(d)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
De-identified health information: This refers to health data that has been processed to remove identifying information, such that there is no reasonable basis for believing that the information can be used to identify an individual. Protected Health Information (PHI): This term encompasses any health information that can be linked to an individual and is subject to privacy regulations. Re-identification: The process of associating de-identified data with the identity of individuals, which transforms the data back into PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
Standard for De-identification: The law establishes that health information must meet specific criteria to be considered de-identified, ensuring that it cannot be connected to individuals. Disclosure Rules: If de-identified information is subsequently re-identified, the entity must adhere to the same privacy regulations that apply to PHI, ensuring continued protection of individuals' health information.
# Application Scenarios
Healthcare researchers using de-identified data for studies without needing consent from individuals, thus facilitating research while protecting privacy. Health information exchanges sharing de-identified data to improve public health outcomes, as the data falls outside the scope of privacy regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions regarding de-identification reinforce the overarching goals of protecting individual privacy while allowing for the use of health data in a manner that benefits public health and research. The emphasis on standards for de-identification and the conditions under which re-identified data may be used highlights the balance between data utility and privacy protection in health information management.
