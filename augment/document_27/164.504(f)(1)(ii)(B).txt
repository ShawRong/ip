# Law
164.504(f)(1)(ii)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
Group Health Plan: A group health plan is a single plan that provides health coverage to a group of people, typically employees of a company or members of an organization. Plan Sponsor: The plan sponsor is the entity that establishes or maintains the group health plan, often the employer or a union. Summary Health Information: This refers to data that summarizes the health information of a group without revealing identifiable details about individuals. It is used for administrative purposes and planning.
# Key Legal Principles
Disclosure Permitted: The law allows for the disclosure of summary health information to the plan sponsor for specific purposes, which can include plan modifications, amendments, or terminations. Compliance with Regulations: The disclosure is subject to prohibitions outlined in related sections, ensuring that personal health information is adequately protected.
# Application Scenarios
A plan sponsor may request summary health information to evaluate whether to modify the existing health plan benefits based on the needs of the participants. An HMO might disclose summary health information to help a plan sponsor assess the financial implications of terminating a particular health plan.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes the importance of maintaining confidentiality while allowing necessary disclosures to facilitate effective management of health plans. It supports the principle that plan sponsors need access to aggregated health data to make informed decisions regarding the operation and sustainability of health plans.
