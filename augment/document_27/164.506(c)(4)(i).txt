# Law
164.506(c)(4)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can identify an individual. Health Care Operations: Activities related to the administrative, financial, legal, and quality improvement aspects of health care that are necessary for the functioning of a health care entity.
# Key Legal Principles
Permissive Disclosure: Covered entities are allowed to share PHI with other covered entities for health care operations under specific conditions, ensuring that both entities have a relationship with the individual whose information is being shared. Relevance to Relationship: The PHI disclosed must pertain to the relationship between the individual and the covered entities, emphasizing the need for contextual relevance in sharing sensitive health information.
# Application Scenarios
A hospital may share a patient's treatment history with a specialist who is treating the same patient, provided both entities have a prior relationship with the patient. A health insurer might disclose claims information to a provider for the purpose of quality assessment and improvement, as both parties have engaged in operations related to the same individual.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law underscores the balance between patient privacy and the operational needs of health care entities, highlighting the conditions under which PHI can be shared to enhance care delivery. It reinforces the principle of patient control over personal health information while allowing necessary disclosures that contribute to health care operations and improve overall health outcomes.
