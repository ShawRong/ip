# Law
160.516(e)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
The concept of 'request for production' pertains to a formal request made by one party to another in a legal proceeding to produce documents or evidence relevant to the case. The 'objection' process allows the party receiving a request to refuse compliance, provided they offer specific reasons for the objection, ensuring that objections are clear and documented.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of timely response mandates that the receiving party must respond to a request for production within 30 days, fostering efficiency in legal proceedings. The principle of judicial discretion is illustrated by the ALJ's ability to extend time frames, which reflects the need for flexibility in legal processes to accommodate various circumstances.
# Application Scenarios
A party may file a request for production of documents during the discovery phase of litigation, prompting the opposing party to either comply or object. If an objection is raised, the requesting party can seek a court order to compel production, which may involve a motion based on the ALJ's discretion to extend timelines.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law enhances the efficiency and clarity of the discovery process by ensuring structured responses to document requests. The ALJ's authority to extend deadlines supports the principles of fairness and justice, allowing for adjustments based on the specific needs of the case.
