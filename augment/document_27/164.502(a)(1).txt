# Law
164.502(a)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entity**: Refers to health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that electronically transmit any health information in connection with a HIPAA transaction. These entities are subject to specific regulations regarding the handling of protected health information (PHI). **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any individually identifiable health information, including demographic data, that relates to a person's health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. **Permitted Uses and Disclosures**: Situations where covered entities are allowed to use or share PHI without obtaining consent from the individual, provided these actions comply with HIPAA regulations.
# Key Legal Principles
**Minimum Necessary Standard**: Covered entities must make reasonable efforts to limit the use and disclosure of PHI to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. **Authorization Requirement**: Certain uses and disclosures of PHI require explicit authorization from the individual, except in cases where the law permits otherwise. **Compliance with Regulatory Framework**: Covered entities must adhere to specific sections of HIPAA (e.g., ยง 164.506, ยง 164.508) that outline the conditions under which PHI can be used or disclosed.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider sharing patient information with another provider for treatment purposes, as permitted under ยง 164.506. A health insurance company using PHI to process claims or for health care operations, which is compliant with the outlined regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
