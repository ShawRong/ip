# Law
164.504(e)(3)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Business Associate: A person or entity that performs functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Protected Health Information (PHI): Any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. Legal Mandate: A requirement imposed by law that obligates a covered entity to disclose PHI to a business associate.
# Key Legal Principles
Good Faith Attempt: A covered entity must make a sincere effort to obtain satisfactory assurances from the business associate regarding the handling of PHI before disclosing any information. Documentation Requirement: If satisfactory assurances cannot be obtained, the covered entity must document the attempt and the reasons for failure, ensuring accountability and transparency.
# Application Scenarios
A covered entity may disclose PHI to a business associate who is legally mandated to report certain health conditions to public health authorities. A healthcare provider may share patient information with a billing service that is required by law to access such information for compliance with healthcare regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision ensures that covered entities can comply with legal obligations while still protecting patient privacy by imposing conditions on the disclosure of PHI. It reinforces the importance of accountability in the handling of sensitive health information, ensuring that even under legal compulsion, efforts are made to protect patient privacy.
