# Law
164.504(e)(2)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Covered Entity: A health care provider, health plan, or health care clearinghouse that transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. Business Associate: A person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information.
# Key Legal Principles
Contractual Obligation: The principle that contracts must be honored and that parties can terminate the agreement if a material breach occurs. Compliance with Statutory Obligations: Covered entities must ensure that their agreements with business associates comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those governing the use and disclosure of protected health information.
# Application Scenarios
A covered entity discovers that a business associate has mishandled patient data, which constitutes a breach of the contract. The covered entity can terminate the contract based on this violation. A healthcare provider and a billing company have a contract, and the billing company fails to implement necessary security measures for protected health information, allowing unauthorized access. The healthcare provider can terminate the contract.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of maintaining compliance and protecting patient information, reinforcing the need for accountability among business associates. The ability to terminate contracts for material breaches supports the overarching goal of the regulation to safeguard protected health information and ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements.
