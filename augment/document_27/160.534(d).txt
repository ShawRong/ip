# Law
160.534(d)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Hearing Procedures**: This section outlines the framework for how evidence is presented during a hearing, emphasizing the importance of proper procedures and timelines. **Admissibility of Evidence**: The rules governing what evidence can be introduced are critical. This includes limits on introducing new evidence after the initial notice or request.
# Key Legal Principles
**15-Day Rule**: This principle requires that evidence be disclosed within a specified timeframe (15 days) prior to the hearing, ensuring that all parties are adequately prepared. **Rebuttal Evidence**: This principle allows parties to introduce new evidence in response to the opposing party's case, even if that evidence was not previously exchanged, promoting fairness in the hearing process.
# Application Scenarios
A party discovers new evidence shortly before a hearing and must determine whether it can be introduced based on the 15-day rule. After both parties present their initial cases, one party may decide to introduce rebuttal evidence that was not previously shared, potentially affecting the outcome.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This section reinforces the procedural integrity of the hearing process, ensuring that both parties have a fair opportunity to present their cases. By detailing evidence admission criteria, this law supports the underlying goal of achieving a just and equitable resolution to disputes.
