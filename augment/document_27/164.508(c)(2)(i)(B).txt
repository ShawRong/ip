# Law
164.508(c)(2)(i)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
The right to revoke authorization: Individuals have the legal ability to withdraw consent for the use or disclosure of their protected health information (PHI) in writing. Notice of privacy practices: Covered entities are required to provide a notice that outlines how they protect PHI and individuals' rights regarding their information.
# Key Legal Principles
Transparency: Covered entities must clearly communicate their practices regarding PHI to individuals, ensuring they understand their rights and how their information may be used. Limitations on revocation: While individuals can revoke authorization, there are exceptions that may limit this right, which must be clearly stated in the notice.
# Application Scenarios
A patient decides to revoke their consent for a healthcare provider to share their medical records with a third party and wants to understand how to do so. A healthcare organization updates its notice of privacy practices to include new exceptions to the revocation of authorization, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision reinforces the importance of both the individual's rights to manage their PHI and the obligation of covered entities to maintain transparency about their practices. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of individual rights and the requirement for clear communication through notices, thereby supporting the overarching goal of protecting patient privacy.
