# Law
164.508(b)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Compound Authorization**: A type of authorization that allows for the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) to be combined with other permissions or authorizations, under specific conditions outlined in the regulation. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any information that relates to an individual's health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be used to identify the individual.
# Key Legal Principles
**Limitations on Combining Authorizations**: The law restricts the combination of authorizations for PHI to ensure that individuals are fully informed about what they are consenting to, thus protecting their privacy rights. **Conditioned vs. Unconditioned Authorizations**: The law distinguishes between authorizations that are conditioned upon receiving treatment and those that are not, requiring clear differentiation for transparency.
# Application Scenarios
A researcher may combine an authorization for using PHI for a research study with another authorization for the same study but must clarify what components are conditioned on receiving treatment. A healthcare provider can issue a compound authorization for research purposes as long as it adheres to the guidelines set forth, ensuring that the patient understands which components are optional.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The regulation emphasizes the importance of patient consent in the context of research, aligning with broader privacy protections under health care laws. It upholds the integrity of patient autonomy by ensuring that individuals can make informed decisions about their health information without coercion.
