# Law
164.504(e)(2)(i)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any health information that can identify an individual and is maintained by a covered entity or business associate. Business Associate: An entity or person that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
Permitted Uses and Disclosures: Business associates can only use or disclose PHI in ways that are allowed by their contract with the covered entity or as required by law. Data Aggregation Services: The contract may allow business associates to aggregate data related to the health care operations of the covered entity to enhance the quality of care.
# Application Scenarios
A health IT company that manages patient data for a hospital may be contracted to analyze health trends by aggregating data from multiple sources, ensuring compliance with the legal standards outlined in the contract. A billing service provider may use aggregated health data to optimize billing processes while adhering to the restrictions on PHI use.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions emphasize the importance of contractual agreements in delineating the boundaries of PHI usage, ensuring that business associates do not exceed their authority. The ability to engage in data aggregation services reflects a balance between operational efficiency for covered entities and the protection of patient privacy.
