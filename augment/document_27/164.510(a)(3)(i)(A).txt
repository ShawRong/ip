# Law
164.510(a)(3)(i)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any individually identifiable health information, including demographic details, that is held by a covered entity. The law emphasizes the need to handle PHI with care, particularly in emergency situations. **Incapacity and Emergency Treatment**: These terms refer to situations where an individual is unable to provide consent for the use or disclosure of their health information due to medical emergencies or their physical condition.
# Key Legal Principles
**Patient Autonomy**: This principle underscores the importance of respecting a patient's prior expressed preferences regarding their health information, reinforcing their right to control who has access to their information. **Confidentiality in Health Care**: The law highlights the necessity of maintaining confidentiality even in situations where immediate disclosure of information may be required, provided that it aligns with the individual's known preferences.
# Application Scenarios
A patient is admitted to a hospital unconscious due to an accident. The healthcare provider can disclose the patient's information to maintain the facility's directory, provided this aligns with any prior expressed preferences the patient had regarding such disclosures. A healthcare provider must determine whether they can disclose a patient's information in an emergency, ensuring it is consistent with any known preferences, such as whether the patient had previously indicated a desire for privacy.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the importance of balancing urgent healthcare needs with the individual's right to privacy and control over their health information. It establishes a framework for healthcare providers to follow in emergency situations, ensuring that patient preferences are honored whenever feasible, thus promoting trust in the healthcare system.
