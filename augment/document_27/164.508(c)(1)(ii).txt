# Law
164.508(c)(1)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
The requirement for specific identification means that an authorization must clearly state who is permitted to use or disclose the protected information, ensuring that only designated individuals or groups can access that information. The concept of 'valid authorization' is crucial in legal contexts, as it sets the framework for how personal information can be shared while maintaining compliance with privacy laws.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of specificity in legal authorizations emphasizes that vague or ambiguous authorizations are not sufficient, thereby protecting individuals' rights regarding their personal data. The principle of accountability in data use mandates that those who have access to sensitive information must be explicitly named, ensuring that users can be held responsible for their actions concerning that information.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider must obtain a valid authorization from a patient that specifies which staff members are allowed to access the patient's medical records. A research institution must identify the specific researchers authorized to use participant data for a study, ensuring compliance with ethical and legal standards.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the importance of consent in the handling of personal data, contributing to the overall framework that protects individual privacy rights. It establishes a clear guideline that enhances the trust between individuals and organizations, thereby supporting the broader goals of privacy legislation.
