This includes converting or translating health information into standardized formats for billing and record-keeping. **Business Associate**: A business associate is an individual or entity that performs functions on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of PHI. The relationship creates a need for legal agreements to ensure compliance with privacy laws.
