# Law
164.508(b)(1)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Valid authorization: This refers to the formal approval necessary under the law for the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). It sets the framework for what constitutes a permissible authorization. Additional elements: This concept indicates that an authorization can include extra information beyond the mandatory elements, as long as these do not contradict the required elements outlined in the law.
# Key Legal Principles
Consistency: Any additional information in a valid authorization must not conflict with the core required elements, ensuring that the intent of the authorization remains clear and lawful. Flexibility in authorizations: The law allows for the inclusion of supplementary information, which can enhance the clarity or specificity of the authorization, thereby accommodating various contexts and needs.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may include specific instructions or limitations in an authorization form, beyond the basic required elements, to clarify how the PHI can be used or disclosed. In research settings, an authorization might include additional information regarding the duration of the consent, provided that this extra detail aligns with the requirements of the law.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision supports the broader framework of patient rights and protections under health privacy laws, emphasizing the importance of informed consent. By allowing additional elements in authorizations, the law aims to enhance clarity and specificity, ultimately fostering better communication and understanding between patients and healthcare providers.
