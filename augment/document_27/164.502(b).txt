# Law
164.502(b)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any information that can identify an individual and relates to their health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care. Minimum Necessary Standard: This principle mandates that covered entities must limit the use, disclosure, and request of PHI to the minimum necessary to achieve the intended purpose.
# Key Legal Principles
Reasonable Efforts: Covered entities must take appropriate steps to ensure that only the minimum necessary PHI is used or disclosed, which emphasizes the importance of safeguarding patient privacy. Compliance with Regulations: Covered entities must adhere to specific regulatory guidelines outlined in §§ 164.502(b), 164.514(d), and 164.530(c) to ensure lawful handling of PHI.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider disclosing patient information to a specialist should only share the information pertinent to the specialist’s role, avoiding unnecessary data. A health insurance company requesting medical records from a provider must specify the exact information needed to process a claim, rather than requesting full medical histories.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the broader framework of patient privacy and data protection established by HIPAA, ensuring that PHI is handled responsibly. It highlights the balance between operational needs of healthcare entities and the right to privacy of individuals, contributing to a culture of trust in healthcare services.
