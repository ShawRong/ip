# Law
164.502(g)(3)(i)(C)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Unemancipated Minor**: A minor who has not been legally granted independence from parental or guardian authority, typically retaining the right to have their healthcare decisions influenced or made by their parents or guardians. **In Loco Parentis**: Refers to a person, such as a guardian, who has the legal authority to act on behalf of a minor in matters including healthcare, similar to a parent.
# Key Legal Principles
**Confidentiality in Healthcare**: This principle emphasizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of patient information, especially in sensitive cases involving minors, where guardians or parents may need to be involved. **Professional Judgment**: Health care professionals must exercise their discretion when determining access to a minor's health information, balancing the rights of the minor with those of the parent or guardian.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may enter into a confidentiality agreement with a minor regarding a sensitive health issue, such as mental health treatment, where the minor prefers that their parents or guardians do not have access to certain information. A parent acting in loco parentis may be involved in discussions about a minor's healthcare, provided they agree to the terms of confidentiality put forth by the healthcare provider.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of respecting the autonomy of unemancipated minors in healthcare decisions while also acknowledging the role of parents or guardians. It establishes a framework where confidentiality agreements can protect the minorâ€™s privacy, ensuring that sensitive health information is disclosed only with the minor's assent.
