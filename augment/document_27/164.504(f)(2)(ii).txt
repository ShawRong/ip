# Law
164.504(f)(2)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any health information that can identify an individual and is created, received, or maintained by a healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse. Plan Sponsor: The entity that establishes or maintains a group health plan, which can be an employer or organization responsible for the plan's administration. Certification Requirement: A formal assurance from the plan sponsor that necessary amendments have been made to the plan documents concerning the use and disclosure of PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
Limitation of Disclosure: The principle that PHI can only be disclosed to the plan sponsor under specific conditions, emphasizing the need for compliance with privacy regulations. Agent Agreements: This principle mandates that any third-party agents receiving PHI must adhere to the same privacy restrictions as the plan sponsor, ensuring consistent protection of sensitive information. Return or Destruction of PHI: If the information is no longer needed, there is an obligation to return or destroy PHI to prevent unauthorized access or use.
# Application Scenarios
A health plan disclosing PHI to an employer for administrative purposes only after receiving the required certification from the employer. An employer ensuring all agents handling PHI are bound by privacy agreements before accessing any protected health information.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of safeguarding PHI through stringent requirements for plan sponsors, aligning with broader healthcare privacy regulations. The requirement for certification reinforces accountability among plan sponsors, supporting the overarching goal of maintaining confidentiality and trust in healthcare relationships.
