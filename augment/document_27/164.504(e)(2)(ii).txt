# Law
164.504(e)(2)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Business Associate: A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Covered Entity: This refers to health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. Protected Health Information (PHI): Any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual.
# Key Legal Principles
Confidentiality: The principle that PHI must be protected from unauthorized use or disclosure. Accountability: Business associates must report any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI to the covered entity, ensuring accountability for handling sensitive information. Compliance: Business associates must adhere to the same privacy and security provisions as covered entities under HIPAA, ensuring they meet legal standards.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider engages a third-party billing company (business associate) to handle patient billing, requiring a contract that mandates safeguarding PHI. A tech company providing cloud services to a hospital must ensure that its contract includes clauses that restrict the use of PHI and outline breach notification procedures.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions outlined in this law establish a framework for protecting PHI between covered entities and their business associates, reinforcing the importance of contractual safeguards. These requirements ensure that business associates understand their obligations regarding PHI, thereby enhancing overall compliance with HIPAA regulations.
