# Law
164.510(b)(1)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. It is crucial for maintaining patient confidentiality. **Covered Entity**: This term includes health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. **Disclosures to Family and Friends**: This concept allows covered entities to share PHI with individuals who are involved in the patient's care or payment for care, emphasizing the importance of family involvement in health decisions.
# Key Legal Principles
**Minimum Necessary Rule**: When disclosing PHI, covered entities must limit the information shared to the minimum necessary to achieve the intended purpose. **Patient Consent**: While the law allows for certain disclosures without explicit consent, it emphasizes the importance of respecting the individual's preferences regarding who may access their health information. **Best Interest Determination**: When the individual is not present or cannot consent, covered entities must use professional judgment to decide if the disclosure is in the individual's best interest.
# Application Scenarios
A patient in an emergency situation where a family member needs access to their medical information to make informed decisions about treatment. A healthcare provider sharing relevant health information with a close friend who is assisting the patient in managing their care, provided the patient has not objected.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law fosters a balance between patient privacy and the need for family involvement in health care, highlighting the importance of communication in patient-centered care. It establishes guidelines for when and how PHI can be shared, ensuring that disclosures are made thoughtfully and in alignment with the patient's wishes.
