# Law
164.508(c)(1)(iv)
# Key Legal Concepts
A valid authorization must include a clear description of the purposes for which health information is to be used or disclosed, ensuring transparency and informed consent. The provision allows for a simplified statement regarding the purpose if the individual requesting the authorization does not specify one, promoting accessibility.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of informed consent is central, as individuals must understand how their health information will be used or disclosed before granting authorization. The principle of individual autonomy is emphasized, allowing individuals to initiate the authorization process and control the disclosure of their health information.
# Application Scenarios
In a healthcare setting, if a patient requests their medical records for personal use, the authorization can simply state 'at the request of the individual' if no specific purpose is provided. When a healthcare provider seeks to share patient information with another provider for treatment purposes, a detailed description of the intended use fosters trust and compliance with legal standards.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the importance of protecting patient privacy while facilitating necessary disclosures in healthcare. It supports a framework that balances the need for information sharing with individual rights, thereby enhancing the overall integrity of health information management.
