# Law
164.502(a)(5)(ii)(B)(2)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any health information that can be linked to an individual, including demographics, medical histories, and payment information, which is protected under regulations to ensure privacy. Covered Entities: These are organizations that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. They include healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses.
# Key Legal Principles
Permitted Uses and Disclosures: Under § 164.506(a), covered entities are allowed to use or disclose PHI without an individual’s authorization for specific purposes such as treatment, payment, and healthcare operations, as long as they comply with other legal requirements. Sale of PHI: The law clarifies that certain disclosures of PHI do not constitute a sale of protected health information, particularly when such disclosures are made for treatment and payment purposes.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discloses patient information to a specialist for treatment without requiring additional authorization, as permitted under § 164.506(a). A health insurance company uses PHI to process a patient's claim for reimbursement, which falls under the permitted uses of PHI.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the importance of protecting patient privacy while also allowing necessary information sharing for healthcare delivery and payment processing. It highlights the balance between patient rights and the operational needs of healthcare providers and insurers in managing PHI.
