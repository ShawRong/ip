Permissible Disclosure: It establishes that disclosures of PHI to plan sponsors are only allowed if they are consistent with specific implementation specifications outlined in the law. Compliance with Plan Documents: The law requires that plan documents must be amended to ensure they incorporate provisions that align with the requirements for disclosing PHI.
# Application Scenarios

# Relationship to Overall Document Argument

It supports the overall framework that governs the relationship between health plans and plan sponsors, emphasizing the need for clear documentation and adherence to legal standards in managing health information.
