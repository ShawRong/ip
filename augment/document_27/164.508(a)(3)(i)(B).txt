# Law
164.508(a)(3)(i)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual and is subject to privacy regulations. Authorization Requirement: Under HIPAA, covered entities must obtain explicit authorization from individuals for the use or disclosure of their PHI for marketing purposes, unless specific exceptions apply.
# Key Legal Principles
Marketing Exception: The law specifies that certain communications, such as promotional gifts of nominal value, do not require prior authorization for the use or disclosure of PHI. Scope of 'Nominal Value': This principle emphasizes the need to define what constitutes a 'nominal value' gift, which is intended to ensure that marketing practices remain ethical and respectful of patient privacy.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider offers a branded pen or notepad to patients during a check-up as a way to promote their services without needing explicit consent. A hospital gives away small gift baskets during a community health event, which includes items of low monetary value, while promoting their health services.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision highlights the balance between marketing interests of healthcare entities and the privacy rights of individuals, ensuring that marketing efforts do not exploit sensitive health information. It reinforces the importance of protecting patient privacy while allowing covered entities to engage in low-impact marketing practices that do not infringe on individual rights.
