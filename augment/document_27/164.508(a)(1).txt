# Law
164.508(a)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any information about health status, provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare that can be linked to an individual. It is crucial for maintaining patient confidentiality. Authorization: A formal consent obtained from an individual allowing a covered entity to use or disclose their protected health information. This must be specific, informed, and compliant with legal standards.
# Key Legal Principles
Consent Requirement: The law establishes that a covered entity must obtain explicit authorization from the individual before using or disclosing their PHI, barring certain exceptions. Consistency with Authorization: Any use or disclosure of PHI must align with the terms outlined in the valid authorization, ensuring that the individualâ€™s specific permissions are respected.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider must acquire a patient's written consent before sharing their medical records with a third-party insurer. A hospital can only disclose patient information for research purposes if the patient has signed an authorization that explicitly allows such use.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of patient autonomy and informed consent in the handling of sensitive health information, reinforcing trust in healthcare. It serves as a foundational standard that guides the practices of covered entities, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations in the healthcare sector.
