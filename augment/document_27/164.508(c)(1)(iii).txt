# Law
164.508(c)(1)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
The concept of 'authorization' is crucial in data privacy laws; it refers to the permission granted by an individual for a covered entity to use or disclose their protected health information (PHI). The identification of individuals or classes of individuals who may receive PHI is a key component of ensuring accountability and transparency in data handling.
# Key Legal Principles
Principle of specificity: An authorization must clearly specify who is permitted to access the information, ensuring that the scope of disclosure is limited to those identified. Principle of informed consent: Individuals must be fully informed about who will have access to their data, thus enabling them to make educated decisions regarding their privacy.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider must obtain explicit authorization listing specific individuals, such as family members or other healthcare professionals, before disclosing a patient's medical records. A research organization may require authorization detailing a class of persons, such as study coordinators, who will have access to participant data for a clinical trial.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law supports the broader regulatory framework that safeguards individual privacy rights by mandating transparency in data sharing. By requiring specific identification of individuals authorized to access PHI, the law reinforces trust between patients and healthcare providers, ultimately promoting compliance with privacy standards.
