# Law
164.504(f)(1)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI): This refers to any individually identifiable health information that is created, received, maintained, or transmitted electronically, subject to strict privacy and security regulations. Plan Sponsor: The entity that establishes and maintains the group health plan, which can be an employer or an organization that provides the health benefits.
# Key Legal Principles
Safeguarding Information: The law mandates that group health plans must ensure that plan sponsors implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect ePHI. Limitation on Disclosure: The law restricts the disclosure of protected health information to the plan sponsor, allowing specific types of information related to enrollment status only, thus protecting individual privacy.
# Application Scenarios
A group health plan may provide the plan sponsor with information indicating whether an employee is currently enrolled or has disenrolled, facilitating the management of employee benefits. Health insurance issuers or HMOs may share enrollment status information with the plan sponsor to assist in plan administration and compliance with benefits regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
By allowing limited disclosures regarding enrollment status while imposing strict confidentiality requirements, the law balances the need for administrative efficiency with the protection of individual health information. The provisions ensure that while plan sponsors need certain information to manage health plans effectively, they are also held accountable to safeguard the sensitive data of participants.
