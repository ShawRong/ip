# Law
160.404(b)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty (CMP):** A financial punishment imposed by a governmental authority for violations of specific laws or regulations, aimed at deterring future non-compliance. **Inflation Adjustment:** The process of adjusting the amount of civil money penalties in accordance with inflationary changes, as mandated by the Federal Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 and its amendments.
# Key Legal Principles
**Prohibition of Penalties for Pre-2009 Violations:** CMPs cannot be imposed for violations that occurred before February 18, 2009, establishing a temporal limitation on enforcement. **Single Penalty for Repeated Violations:** If a violation falls under multiple similar provisions, a CMP can only be assessed for one of those provisions, which prevents duplicative penalties.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider found to have violated HIPAA regulations may face a CMP, but only for violations after February 18, 2009. An entity that breaches both specific and general administrative simplification provisions will only incur one CMP, regardless of the number of provisions violated.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The limitations set forth in ยง 160.404(b) are crucial for ensuring that penalties are applied fairly and consistently, particularly in relation to the timing of violations. The relationship between the inflation adjustment and the imposition of CMPs demonstrates the government's commitment to adapting penalties to current economic conditions, thereby maintaining their deterrent effect.
