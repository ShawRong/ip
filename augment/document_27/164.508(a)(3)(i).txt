# Key Legal Concepts
Authorization Requirement: Covered entities must obtain explicit authorization from individuals before using or disclosing their protected health information (PHI) for marketing purposes, ensuring that individuals have control over their personal health data. Exceptions to Authorization: There are specific exceptions where authorization is not required, such as face-to-face communications and promotional gifts of nominal value, which are designed to facilitate communication without imposing a burden on the entities.
# Key Legal Principles
Privacy Protection: The law emphasizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of individuals' health information, aligning with broader privacy regulations and principles. Informed Consent: The requirement for authorization underscores the principle of informed consent, where individuals should understand and agree to how their information is used.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discusses a new service directly with a patient during an appointment, which qualifies as a face-to-face communication and does not require prior authorization. A hospital gives patients branded pens or notepads as promotional gifts, which are considered of nominal value and thus do not necessitate authorization under the marketing rules.
