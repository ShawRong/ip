# Law
160.104(c)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
The compliance date establishes the timeline by which entities must adhere to modified standards or specifications. The effective date of the final rule is the date when the modifications become legally binding, which sets the stage for the compliance date.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of reasonable time frames for compliance ensures that affected parties have sufficient time to adjust to new regulations. Transparency in rule-making is essential, as stakeholders must be informed about when changes take effect to comply effectively.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider must update its data handling practices in response to a new compliance date set by the Secretary following a modification. A technology vendor needs to adjust its software products to meet new standards that become effective in 180 days.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision emphasizes the regulatory framework's intent to balance prompt implementation of modifications with the practical needs of affected parties. The structure of the compliance date reinforces the importance of stakeholder preparedness in the transition to new standards.
