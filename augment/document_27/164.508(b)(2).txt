# Law
164.508(b)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
Defective Authorization: This refers to any authorization that fails to meet specific legal requirements, rendering it invalid for the purpose of disclosing protected health information. Expiration of Authorization: An authorization becomes invalid if its expiration date has passed or the event that triggers its expiration is known to have occurred. Revocation of Authorization: If a covered entity knows that an authorization has been revoked by the individual, it is no longer valid. Completeness of Authorization: An authorization must be fully completed according to the required elements; if any part is missing, it is considered defective. Material Misrepresentation: If any significant information within the authorization is known to be false, the authorization is rendered invalid.
# Key Legal Principles
Validity of Authorizations: Authorizations must meet all specified criteria to be considered valid; any defect leads to automatic invalidation. Covered Entity Responsibility: Covered entities have a duty to verify the validity of authorizations and are accountable for ensuring that any authorizations they act upon are legally sound. Consumer Rights: Individuals have the right to control their health information and can revoke their authorizations, reflecting the principle of autonomy in health care.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider attempts to disclose a patient's medical records based on an authorization that has expired. A patient revokes their authorization for the release of health information, and the covered entity must cease any further disclosures. A health organization receives an authorization that is incomplete and must determine whether it can legally disclose the requested information.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions outlined in 164.508(b)(2) emphasize the importance of maintaining stringent standards for authorizations to protect patient privacy. By establishing clear criteria for valid authorizations, the law supports the broader goals of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regarding the protection of health information.
