# Key Legal Concepts
Individually identifiable health information: This concept refers to any health data that can be linked to a specific individual, including details about their physical or mental health status, healthcare provision, or payment for healthcare services. Reasonable basis for identification: This principle establishes that if there is a reasonable expectation that the information could be used to identify an individual, such information falls under the definition of individually identifiable health information.
# Key Legal Principles
Privacy and confidentiality: The law emphasizes the importance of maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of health information, ensuring that individuals' health data is protected from unauthorized disclosure. Consent and disclosure: There are legal requirements regarding obtaining consent from individuals before disclosing their identifiable health information, which is crucial for protecting their rights.
# Application Scenarios
Healthcare providers must ensure that patient records are handled securely to prevent unauthorized access, especially when the information can identify patients. Researchers must obtain consent when using health data that could identify individuals, ensuring compliance with legal standards for privacy.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law supports the overarching argument for protecting individual privacy in healthcare by clearly defining what constitutes identifiable health information. By establishing criteria for what can be considered identifiable, the law aids in enforcing compliance and accountability among healthcare entities.
