# Law
160.402(a)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty**: A financial penalty imposed by a regulatory authority on entities that violate specific legal provisions, in this case related to administrative simplification. **Covered Entity**: An organization or individual that is subject to regulations under the law, typically involved in handling protected health information. **Business Associate**: A person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information.
# Key Legal Principles
**Violation Determination**: The Secretary has the authority to determine whether a covered entity or business associate has violated an administrative simplification provision, which serves as the basis for imposing penalties. **Affirmative Defenses**: Under ยง 160.410, entities may present defenses against penalties, which can affect the outcome of enforcement actions.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider fails to implement required privacy safeguards, leading to unauthorized access to patient information, resulting in a civil money penalty. A business associate inadvertently breaches contract terms regarding data handling, prompting the Secretary to evaluate the breach and potentially impose a penalty.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The document establishes a framework for enforcing compliance with administrative simplification provisions, highlighting the consequences of violations and the defenses available to entities. By outlining the basis for civil money penalties and the possibility of affirmative defenses, the law encourages compliance and provides a clear mechanism for accountability.
