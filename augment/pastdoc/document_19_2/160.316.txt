**Protection Against Retaliation**: The law explicitly prohibits intimidation or retaliation against individuals who engage in activities protected under the law, fostering a safe environment for reporting and participating in investigations. **Good Faith Belief Standard**: The principle that individuals must have a reasonable belief that the practices they oppose are unlawful is crucial to determining the legitimacy of their opposition. **Reasonableness of Opposition**: The manner in which individuals oppose unlawful practices must be reasonable, emphasizing the need to balance advocacy with compliance obligations regarding protected health information.
