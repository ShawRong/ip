# Law
160.402(b)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Joint and Several Liability**: This concept holds that in the context of affiliated covered entities, each entity can be held liable for the entire penalty if one of its members violates part 164, unless another member is found responsible. **Affiliated Covered Entities**: These are groups of covered entities that are under common control, allowing for shared responsibility and liability in certain legal contexts.
# Key Legal Principles
**Civil Money Penalty**: A financial penalty imposed by the Secretary for violations of privacy and security regulations, intended to enforce compliance among covered entities. **Responsibility and Accountability**: The principle that covered entities must maintain accountability for compliance, even when they are part of a larger group, thereby incentivizing diligent oversight.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare organization that is part of a larger hospital system may face penalties for data breaches committed by any member of the system, emphasizing the need for comprehensive compliance measures across all entities. Two affiliated health insurance companies may be jointly liable for a violation, prompting them to implement unified privacy practices to avoid penalties.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the shared responsibility among affiliated entities, which is crucial for maintaining robust compliance with privacy regulations. It establishes a clear framework for accountability that can deter violations by ensuring that all members of an affiliated group are aware of their potential liability.
