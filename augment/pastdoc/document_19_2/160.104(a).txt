# Law
160.104(a)
# Key Legal Concepts
The concept of modification refers to the ability of the Secretary to change existing standards or implementation specifications, which is crucial for maintaining relevance and compliance. The stipulation that modifications can only occur once every 12 months (except as noted in paragraph (b)) establishes a framework for stability in regulations, allowing entities time to adapt to changes.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of regulatory stability: Limiting modifications to once per year helps prevent confusion and allows stakeholders to plan accordingly. The principle of necessary modification: The Secretary's authority to modify standards when deemed necessary emphasizes the need for flexibility in regulatory compliance.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare organization may need to adjust its practices to comply with a newly adopted standard, requiring the Secretary to evaluate if a modification is necessary within the first year. A technology provider might face challenges in meeting a standard, prompting the Secretary to consider a modification to facilitate compliance.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law underscores the balance between regulatory flexibility and stability, ensuring that while modifications can be made, they are controlled to prevent disruption. It supports the broader framework of regulatory compliance, emphasizing the need for standards to be practical and adaptable while maintaining a structured approach to changes.
