# Law
160.314(a)(1)(iv)
# Key Legal Concepts
Subpoena: A legal document that orders an individual or organization to provide evidence or testimony in a legal proceeding. Document Production: The process of gathering and presenting documents or items requested in a subpoena as part of a legal investigation or trial.
# Key Legal Principles
Specificity: The requirement that a subpoena must clearly specify the documents or items being requested to ensure compliance and avoid ambiguity. Reasonableness: The expectation that the description of requested documents should be reasonable, allowing for a manageable scope of production without undue burden on the recipient.
# Application Scenarios
A court may issue a subpoena to a business to produce financial records relevant to a fraud investigation. An attorney might issue a subpoena to a witness to obtain emails related to a breach of contract case.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the need for clarity and precision in legal requests, reinforcing the integrity of the judicial process. By requiring a reasonably specific description, the law helps prevent overly broad or vague subpoenas that could infringe on the rights of individuals or entities.
