Discovery: The legal process through which parties obtain evidence from one another, including documents, to prepare for a hearing.
# Key Legal Principles
Due Process: Ensures that all parties have a fair opportunity to present their case and access necessary information. Efficiency in Legal Proceedings: The principle that prehearing conferences should promote a more efficient legal process by resolving issues before the formal hearing.
# Application Scenarios
An ALJ may call a prehearing conference to identify documents that each party must produce for the hearing. Parties may clarify the scope of discovery during a prehearing conference to avoid disputes later in the process.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision for document discovery relates to the ALJ's role in ensuring that hearings are based on adequate evidence. The emphasis on prehearing conferences underscores the importance of preparation and organization in administrative hearings.
