Evidence Management: The ALJ can rule on the admissibility of evidence, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the hearing process. Summary Judgment: The provision for summary judgment allows the ALJ to resolve cases without a full hearing when there are no disputed material facts.
# Key Legal Principles
Due Process: The ALJ must conduct hearings in a manner that respects the rights of all parties, ensuring that they are notified and can participate effectively.
