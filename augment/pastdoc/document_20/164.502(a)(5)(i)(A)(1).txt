# Law
164.502(a)(5)(i)(A)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
Eligibility rules: These are the guidelines that determine who qualifies for benefits under a health plan or policy, including the conditions for enrollment and continued coverage. Cost-sharing mechanisms: This refers to the methods by which costs are shared between the insurer and the insured, including changes in deductibles that may be influenced by certain behaviors or activities.
# Key Legal Principles
Non-discrimination: The eligibility rules must apply equally to all individuals without discrimination based on health status or other protected characteristics. Transparency: Insurers are required to clearly communicate the eligibility criteria and any changes to cost-sharing mechanisms to policyholders.
# Application Scenarios
A health plan may implement a wellness program that offers reduced deductibles for individuals who complete specific health assessments. Eligibility determinations may be affected by changes in a member's health status, requiring insurers to reassess coverage options regularly.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law supports the broader objective of ensuring that health insurance plans operate fairly and transparently regarding eligibility and benefits. It emphasizes the importance of linking health incentives with eligibility, encouraging policyholders to engage in health-promoting behaviors.
