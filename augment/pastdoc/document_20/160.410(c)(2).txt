# Law
160.410(c)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty**: A financial penalty imposed on entities for violations of regulations. In this context, it refers to penalties that the Secretary may impose for non-compliance with specific laws. **Covered Entity or Business Associate**: Refers to organizations or individuals that handle protected health information and are subject to compliance requirements under the law. **Reasonable Diligence**: The standard of care that requires entities to take appropriate actions to discover and correct violations in a timely manner.
# Key Legal Principles
**Mitigation of Penalties**: Entities can avoid civil money penalties if they can demonstrate that they corrected the violation within a specified timeframe after becoming aware of it. **Timeframe for Correction**: The law establishes specific periods (30 days and additional periods as determined by the Secretary) within which violations can be corrected to avoid penalties.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discovers a data breach and takes corrective action within 30 days, thereby potentially avoiding penalties. A business associate realizes it failed to comply with a privacy regulation but acts swiftly to remedy the situation before the Secretary imposes a penalty.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of timely correction of violations, aiming to encourage compliance rather than punitive measures. The provision aligns with broader regulatory goals of promoting accountability while allowing entities a chance to rectify their mistakes without severe financial repercussions.
