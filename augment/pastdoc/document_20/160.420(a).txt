Notice Requirement: The law mandates that the Secretary must provide written notice to the respondent if a penalty is proposed, ensuring that the respondent is informed of the potential consequences. Statutory Basis: The notice must reference the specific statutory authority under which the penalty is proposed, establishing the legal foundation for the enforcement action.

Right to a Hearing: The respondent is entitled to a hearing if they request one within a specified timeframe, protecting their due process rights.
# Key Legal Principles
Due Process: The requirement for written notice and the opportunity for a hearing reflect fundamental due process principles, ensuring that individuals have the chance to contest penalties. Accountability: By requiring a detailed explanation of the findings and circumstances, the law promotes accountability in the imposition of penalties. Timeliness: The provision for a 90-day period to request a hearing underscores the importance of timely responses in administrative processes.

In cases where statistical sampling indicates non-compliance, the Secretary must provide the relevant study to the respondent, ensuring that the basis for penalties is clear.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision supports the overall regulatory framework by ensuring that penalties are not imposed arbitrarily, but rather based on documented findings and due process. By outlining the necessary elements of the notice, the law reinforces the importance of transparency and fairness in administrative enforcement actions.
