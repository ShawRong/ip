164.504(e)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
Business Associate: A person or entity that performs services for or on behalf of a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Covered Entity: An organization or individual that is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and handles PHI. Material Breach: A significant violation of a contract that impairs the contract's purpose or performance.
# Key Legal Principles
Contractual Obligations: Contracts between covered entities and business associates must include specific provisions to ensure compliance with HIPAA standards. Knowledge and Responsibility: Covered entities and business associates are responsible for monitoring their respective affiliates' compliance and must take action upon discovering breaches. Reasonable Steps: Both covered entities and business associates must take appropriate actions to rectify breaches or violations and may terminate contracts if necessary.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider (covered entity) enters into a contract with a billing service (business associate) that processes patient information and must ensure the contract complies with HIPAA requirements. A business associate discovers that a subcontractor is mishandling PHI; the business associate must take steps to address this breach and may need to terminate the subcontract if the issue persists.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision establishes standards for business associate contracts, which are critical for ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations. It underscores the importance of accountability and proactive measures in maintaining the privacy and security of protected health information.
