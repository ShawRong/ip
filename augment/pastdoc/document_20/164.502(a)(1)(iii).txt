# Law
164.502(a)(1)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual, and which is protected under privacy regulations. Covered Entity: A covered entity is a healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse that transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction.
# Key Legal Principles
Permitted Uses and Disclosures: Covered entities are allowed to use or disclose PHI as long as it falls within specific permitted categories established by HIPAA, which ensures compliance with privacy regulations. Minimum Necessary Standard: This principle mandates that when PHI is used or disclosed, it should be limited to the minimum necessary information to achieve the intended purpose, thereby protecting patient privacy.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider sharing patient information with a billing department for claims processing must ensure only the necessary information is disclosed, adhering to the minimum necessary standard. A hospital may incidentally disclose patient information during a conversation in a public area, but must ensure that it complies with relevant requirements to protect against unauthorized access.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of maintaining patient confidentiality while allowing necessary information sharing under controlled conditions. It reinforces the need for compliance with specific regulatory standards, ensuring that any incidental disclosures do not compromise the integrity of patient privacy protections.
