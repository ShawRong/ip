# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider suspects that a patient has been abused and must decide whether to disclose information to authorities or other entities to protect the individual. A social worker assesses a case involving potential neglect and uses reasonable belief to justify the sharing of information with law enforcement.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the protection of individuals who may be vulnerable due to domestic violence, reinforcing the need for confidentiality while allowing for necessary disclosures. It highlights the balance between patient privacy and the obligation to act in situations where there is a reasonable belief of abuse or neglect.
