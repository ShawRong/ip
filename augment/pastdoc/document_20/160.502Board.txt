# Key Legal Concepts
The term 'Board' refers specifically to the members of the HHS Departmental Appeals Board, which is responsible for adjudicating appeals related to decisions made by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The structure of the Board, consisting of panels of three members, highlights the principle of collective decision-making in administrative law.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of due process is implied, as the Board's function involves fair hearings and the issuance of decisions that can impact individuals and entities affected by HHS determinations. The principle of administrative efficiency is also significant, as the use of panels aims to streamline the decision-making process while ensuring adequate review.
# Application Scenarios
An individual appealing a decision related to Medicare eligibility may bring their case before the Board for review. A healthcare provider disputing a sanction imposed by HHS could seek a hearing before the Board to contest the decision.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The definition of the Board clarifies the authority and structure involved in the appeals process, which is crucial for understanding how decisions are made and reviewed within HHS. By outlining the composition of the Board, the law supports the document's broader argument about ensuring accountability and transparency in administrative decisions.
