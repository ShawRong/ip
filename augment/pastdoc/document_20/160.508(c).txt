# Key Legal Concepts
The authority of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) is limited to ensure compliance with federal statutes and regulations. The ALJ must defer to published guidance that aligns with existing statutes and regulations, emphasizing the importance of following established legal standards.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of deference dictates that the ALJ cannot invalidate or disregard federal laws or regulations in their rulings. The prohibition against entering a directed verdict underscores the ALJ's role as an impartial adjudicator rather than a decision-maker who concludes a case prematurely. The requirement that the ALJ cannot compel settlement negotiations reinforces the voluntary nature of settlement in administrative proceedings.
# Application Scenarios
When a case is presented before the ALJ, they must navigate the proceedings without challenging the validity of federal laws, ensuring their decisions are consistent with those laws. In disputes where parties seek a quick resolution, the ALJ's inability to compel negotiations highlights the importance of voluntary agreements in administrative law.
