# Law
160.103(Health%20plan)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
Health Plan: Refers to any individual or group plan that provides or pays for medical care as defined under the PHS Act. Excepted Benefits: Specific benefits that are excluded from the definition of a health plan, allowing for certain programs or policies to be differentiated from standard health plans.
# Key Legal Principles
Exclusion Criteria: The law outlines specific exclusions from what constitutes a health plan, ensuring clarity on what is not covered under this definition. Government-Funded Programs: It distinguishes between health plans and government-funded programs that do not fall under the usual health plan definitions.
# Application Scenarios
A policy providing limited benefits, such as dental or vision care, may be considered an excepted benefit and therefore not classified as a health plan. A government program that provides direct health care services without structuring as a traditional health plan would be excluded from this definition.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The exclusions help delineate between various types of health coverage, which is crucial for regulatory clarity in the healthcare landscape. Understanding these exclusions allows stakeholders to identify what is covered under health plans and what falls outside of this scope, influencing policy and funding decisions.
