# Law
160.310(c)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any health information that can be used to identify an individual and is maintained by the Secretary during investigations or compliance reviews. The law emphasizes the confidentiality of this information. **Disclosure Limitations**: The law outlines specific conditions under which PHI can be disclosed, emphasizing that such disclosures must be necessary for compliance enforcement, required by law, or permitted under certain federal regulations.
# Key Legal Principles
**Confidentiality Principle**: The principle of confidentiality protects individuals' health information from unauthorized disclosure, thereby maintaining trust in healthcare systems and compliance with privacy regulations. **Compliance and Enforcement**: The law supports the enforcement of administrative simplification provisions by allowing limited disclosures of PHI when necessary to ensure compliance with health regulations.
# Application Scenarios
During an HHS investigation into a healthcare provider, PHI may be reviewed but will only be disclosed if it is necessary to determine compliance with health regulations. When legal actions are taken to enforce compliance with health standards, the Secretary may use PHI as evidence, adhering to the strict guidelines for its disclosure.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions highlight the balance between protecting patient privacy and allowing necessary disclosures for compliance and enforcement, reflecting a commitment to both individual rights and public health. This law serves as a foundational element in discussions about health information privacy, showcasing how legal frameworks can facilitate accountability while safeguarding sensitive data.
