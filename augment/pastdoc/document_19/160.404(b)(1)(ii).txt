# Law
160.404(b)(1)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty (CMP)**: A financial penalty imposed by government agencies for violations of laws or regulations, intended to deter non-compliance and promote adherence to legal standards. **Identical Violations**: Refers to repeated breaches of the same regulatory provision, where each occurrence may be subject to separate penalties.
# Key Legal Principles
**Proportionality of Punishment**: The principle that penalties should be proportionate to the severity and frequency of violations, ensuring fairness in enforcement. **Temporal Scope of Enforcement**: A concept indicating that laws and penalties apply within specific timeframes, highlighting the importance of when violations occur relative to enforcement actions.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider repeatedly failing to comply with patient privacy regulations may incur multiple penalties if these violations are classified as identical within the calendar year. A company that breaches environmental regulations multiple times within a year could face cumulative penalties exceeding the established threshold if the violations are deemed identical.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision establishes a clear limit on the financial repercussions for identical violations, emphasizing the regulatory framework's intent to impose reasonable and predictable penalties. It underscores the necessity for entities to maintain compliance, as exceeding the threshold of $25,000 for identical violations signals heightened scrutiny and potential for increased penalties.
