# Law
160.205
# Key Legal Concepts
Preemption: This concept refers to the legal principle whereby federal law takes precedence over state law when there is a conflict between the two. In this context, it implies that federal standards may override state laws if exceptions are granted under the specified subpart. Exception Duration: The law establishes that exceptions granted remain effective until certain conditions are met, specifically if the underlying state law or federal standard changes materially or if the Secretary revokes the exception.
# Key Legal Principles
Material Change: An exception can be revoked if there is a material change in either the state law or the federal standard that invalidates the justification for the exception. This ensures that exceptions are not permanent if circumstances change. Secretary's Authority: The law grants the Secretary the power to revoke exceptions based on assessments of necessity, emphasizing regulatory oversight and flexibility in managing exceptions.
# Application Scenarios
If a state's healthcare regulation is modified significantly, it may trigger a review of federal exceptions granted under ยง 160.205 to determine if they are still valid. A federal agency may assess whether to revoke an exception if it finds that the original reasons for granting it are no longer applicable due to new evidence or changes in policy.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions in ยง 160.205 support the overall framework of balancing state and federal regulations by allowing for exceptions while also providing mechanisms for their review and potential revocation. This law underscores the importance of adaptability in regulatory practices, ensuring that exceptions are relevant and justified in light of evolving legal and operational standards.
