# Law
164.502(g)(3)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Unemancipated Minors: Refers to individuals who are under the legal age of majority and cannot make health care decisions independently. Personal Representative: A person (such as a parent or guardian) authorized to make decisions on behalf of another individual, particularly regarding health care and access to protected health information (PHI). Protected Health Information (PHI): Any information held by a covered entity that relates to an individual's health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be used to identify the individual.
# Key Legal Principles
Authority of Parents/Guardians: Under certain laws, parents or guardians may have the right to access their unemancipated minor's PHI, provided it aligns with state law. Professional Judgment: Health care professionals must use their discretion when determining whether to grant access to PHI, ensuring their decisions are consistent with applicable state laws. Limits on Disclosure: There are specific conditions under which a covered entity may or may not disclose PHI about unemancipated minors to parents or guardians, based on state law.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider may need to decide whether to share a minor's medical information with a parent when the minor is seeking treatment for a sensitive issue, such as mental health or reproductive health. A covered entity must navigate varying state laws regarding the disclosure of a minor's health information to ensure compliance, particularly when those laws are inconsistent.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law establishes a framework for handling PHI related to unemancipated minors, balancing the rights of minors with those of their parents or guardians. It underscores the importance of adhering to state laws while also emphasizing the professional discretion of health care providers in managing sensitive information.
