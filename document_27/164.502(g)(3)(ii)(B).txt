# Law
164.502(g)(3)(ii)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual, particularly in the context of minors. Covered Entity: A health care provider, health plan, or health care clearinghouse that transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. Unemancipated Minor: A person under the age of majority who is not legally independent from their parents or guardians. In Loco Parentis: A legal doctrine allowing a person to act in the best interests of a child in the absence of the parent or guardian.
# Key Legal Principles
Confidentiality: The principle that health information should be kept private and disclosed only under specific circumstances or with appropriate consent. Parental Rights vs. Minor's Rights: The balancing of parental access to a child's health information against the minor's right to privacy, particularly in cases where state laws provide different standards. State Law Precedence: The principle that state laws can impose stricter requirements than federal laws regarding the disclosure of health information.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider treating an unemancipated minor must evaluate whether state laws restrict disclosure of the minor's health information to their parents. When an unemancipated minor seeks treatment for sensitive issues (e.g., mental health, sexual health), the provider must assess their obligation to keep that information confidential from parents.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This section emphasizes the importance of protecting the privacy of unemancipated minors in health care contexts, indicating that state laws may further restrict disclosures. It highlights the complexity of health information access rights, underscoring the importance of adhering to both federal and state regulations.
