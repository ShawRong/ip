**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any information held by a covered entity or business associate that relates to health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care services that can identify an individual. **Covered Entity**: Entities such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that are subject to HIPAA regulations and must protect PHI. **Business Associate**: A person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
**Permitted Uses and Disclosures**: Covered entities and business associates may only use or disclose PHI in specific circumstances as outlined by HIPAA regulations, emphasizing the need for compliance. **Compliance and Oversight**: Business associates are subject to compliance reviews by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure they are adhering to HIPAA requirements. **Individual Rights**: Individuals have the right to access their electronic health information, which covered entities and business associates must facilitate.
# Application Scenarios
A business associate must disclose PHI to the Secretary of Health and Human Services when required to assess compliance with HIPAA regulations. A business associate is obligated to provide PHI to a covered entity or individual when fulfilling a request for an electronic copy of health information.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
