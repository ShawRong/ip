# Law
164.512(b)(1)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted by a covered entity, which is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Public Health Activities: Encompasses a range of activities aimed at promoting and protecting the health of populations, including monitoring and responding to health threats. FDA-Regulated Products: Products that fall under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration, including drugs, medical devices, and food products. Adverse Events Reporting: The process of documenting and reporting any undesired or harmful effects resulting from the use of a product, which is essential for ensuring public safety.
# Key Legal Principles
Permitted Disclosures: Covered entities are allowed to disclose PHI for specific public health purposes without individual consent, ensuring that necessary health information can be shared to protect public health. Accountability in Reporting: Entities responsible for FDA-regulated products must report issues related to quality, safety, or effectiveness, thereby supporting regulatory oversight and consumer safety. Compliance with Regulatory Standards: Entities must adhere to FDA regulations, which govern the safety and effectiveness of products, ensuring that health-related products meet established standards.
# Application Scenarios
A pharmaceutical company identifies a serious adverse effect linked to one of its drugs and reports this information to the FDA, facilitating public health monitoring. A medical device manufacturer tracks issues related to its product and discloses necessary information to the FDA to initiate a recall, protecting consumers from potential harm.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of using and disclosing PHI in ways that support public health initiatives, thereby reinforcing the role of covered entities in maintaining consumer safety. It aligns with broader regulatory objectives by ensuring that entities involved with FDA-regulated products are held accountable for their safety and effectiveness, ultimately protecting public health.
