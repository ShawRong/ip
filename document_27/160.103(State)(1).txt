# Law
160.103(State)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
**State**: In this context, 'State' refers to the legal definition provided in the relevant sections of the United States Code, particularly as it pertains to health plans governed by federal law. **Health Plan**: A health plan refers to an arrangement for the financing and delivery of health care services, which is established or regulated under federal law.
# Key Legal Principles
**Federal Supremacy**: This principle indicates that federal law takes precedence over state law in cases where conflicts arise, particularly in areas where the federal government has established regulations. **Interpretation of Federal Statutes**: The law emphasizes the need to refer to specific sections of the United States Code for the precise definition and implications of 'State' as they apply to federally regulated health plans.
# Application Scenarios
A health insurance provider needs to determine whether its operations are compliant with federal regulations and how 'State' is defined under the applicable sections of the United States Code. A legal dispute arises regarding the applicability of state regulations versus federal regulations in the administration of a health plan established under federal law.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law clarifies the interplay between state definitions and federal regulations, illustrating the importance of understanding jurisdictional boundaries in health care law. It supports the argument that federal definitions govern state interpretations in the context of health plans, thereby reinforcing the authority of federal law in health care matters.
