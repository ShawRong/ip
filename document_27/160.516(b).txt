# Key Legal Concepts
The term 'documents' encompasses a wide range of materials, including reports, records, and other forms of data, emphasizing the breadth of what can be requested during discovery. The requirement that electronically stored data must be produced in an accessible format highlights the importance of technology in modern legal proceedings and the need for compliance with data accessibility standards.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of discoverability dictates that relevant information must be made available to parties involved in legal proceedings, ensuring transparency and fairness in the discovery process. The principle of non-creation means that parties are not obliged to create new documents for discovery but must provide existing data in a usable format, balancing the need for information with the burden of production.
# Application Scenarios
In a lawsuit where one party requests financial records from another, the definition of 'documents' would necessitate that all relevant reports and electronic records be provided. When a company is sued and needs to provide internal communications or data from electronic systems, it must do so in a format that the requesting party can easily access and utilize.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law supports the overarching goal of discovery, which is to ensure that all relevant evidence is available to both parties, thereby promoting a fair trial. The clarity regarding electronic data production aligns with modern litigation practices, recognizing the pivotal role of digital information in legal contexts and the need for accessible evidence.
