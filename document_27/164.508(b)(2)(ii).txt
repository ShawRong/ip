# Law
164.508(b)(2)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
The concept of valid authorization is essential in legal documentation, particularly in healthcare and data privacy contexts. A valid authorization must be complete and free from defects to be recognized legally. The specification of core elements and requirements in paragraph (c) emphasizes the need for certain mandatory information in an authorization document, ensuring it meets regulatory standards.
# Key Legal Principles
Defective authorizations are invalid, which underscores the necessity for compliance with specified legal requirements to protect parties involved in the authorization process. The principle of completeness in documentation emphasizes that any missing information relating to essential elements may render the authorization ineffective.
# Application Scenarios
Healthcare providers must ensure that patient authorization forms are fully completed to allow for the release of medical records, thereby avoiding legal complications. Organizations handling personal data must verify that authorizations for data sharing are complete and compliant with regulations to maintain the legality of their operations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the importance of compliance with specified requirements, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of the authorization process. The focus on defects and completeness in authorizations supports broader legal frameworks aimed at protecting individual rights and ensuring proper data handling practices.
