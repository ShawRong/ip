# Law
164.512(a)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any information that can identify an individual and relates to their health condition, healthcare provision, or payment for healthcare. Covered Entity: Organizations or individuals that provide healthcare services and transmit health information electronically, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Authorization: A formal permission obtained from an individual allowing the use or disclosure of their PHI under specific circumstances.
# Key Legal Principles
Compliance with Law: A covered entity may use or disclose PHI only to the extent that such actions are explicitly required by law, ensuring adherence to legal requirements. Limited Disclosure: Any use or disclosure of PHI must be confined to what is necessary to satisfy the requirements of the law, preventing overreach and safeguarding individual privacy. Oral Communication: In certain situations, information regarding the use or disclosure of PHI can be communicated orally, streamlining the process while still adhering to legal standards.
# Application Scenarios
Law enforcement requests for health information in criminal investigations where the disclosure is mandated by a legal statute. Mandatory reporting of certain health conditions, such as communicable diseases, to public health authorities as required by state law.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
Section 164.512(a) establishes the framework for legally mandated uses and disclosures of PHI, reinforcing the balance between public interest and individual privacy rights. This section forms a critical part of the broader HIPAA regulations, ensuring that while PHI is protected, necessary disclosures can occur without individual authorization when legally required.
