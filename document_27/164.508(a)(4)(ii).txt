# Law
164.508(a)(4)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Authorization: A formal permission granted by an individual or entity, allowing the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) under specified conditions. Protected Health Information (PHI): Any individually identifiable health information that is held or transmitted by a covered entity, as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Remuneration: Payment or compensation received by a covered entity in exchange for disclosing PHI, which must be clearly stated in the authorization.
# Key Legal Principles
Transparency: Individuals must be informed when their PHI is sold or disclosed for remuneration, ensuring that they understand the implications of their authorization. Consent: The requirement for explicit consent in the form of authorization ensures that individuals maintain control over their own health information.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider selling patient data to a research firm must obtain authorization from patients, stating that the sale will result in remuneration. A health insurance company disclosing patient information to a marketing company must ensure that the authorization clearly specifies the potential financial gain involved.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the necessity for transparency and patient consent in transactions involving PHI, aligning with the broader goals of protecting patient privacy. It reinforces the principle that financial considerations must be disclosed in health information transactions, thereby holding covered entities accountable for their practices.
