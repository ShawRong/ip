# Law
164.502(g)(3)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Unemancipated Minor**: A minor who has not been granted legal independence from their parents or guardians, which means they typically cannot make certain legal decisions, including those regarding health care, without parental consent. **Personal Representative**: A person authorized to make decisions on behalf of another, in this case, a parent or guardian acting for an unemancipated minor in health care matters. **Confidentiality in Health Care**: The principle that health care information must be kept private, and requires specific consent for sharing personal health information.
# Key Legal Principles
**Minor's Consent**: Under certain conditions, minors can consent to their own health care without the need for parental approval, allowing them autonomy in specific health care decisions. **Informed Consent**: The requirement that individuals (or their representatives) must provide consent based on understanding the nature of the health care services being provided, which applies to minors in situations where they can consent independently. **Assent of Guardians**: The principle that a parent or guardian can agree to keep health care decisions confidential between the minor and the health care provider, reinforcing the minor's autonomy.
# Application Scenarios
A minor seeking reproductive health services may consent to treatment without parental notification, provided they meet the legal criteria outlined. A health care provider may engage in confidential consultations with a minor about mental health services, with the understanding that a parent or guardian has agreed to confidentiality.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the balance between protecting the rights of unemancipated minors to make health care decisions while recognizing the role of parents or guardians as personal representatives. It addresses the complexities of health care consent, ensuring that while minors can have autonomy in certain situations, there are safeguards regarding confidentiality and representation.
