# Law
164.502(a)(1)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entities**: Organizations or individuals that provide health care services, transmit health information, or perform billing functions and are subject to HIPAA regulations. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any information that relates to an individual's health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual.
# Key Legal Principles
**Permitted Uses and Disclosures**: Covered entities may use or disclose PHI without patient consent for specific purposes, including treatment, payment, and health care operations, as outlined in the regulations. **Compliance with Regulations**: Any use or disclosure of PHI must adhere to the stipulations set forth in related sections, particularly ยง 164.506, which specifies conditions under which PHI can be disclosed for treatment, payment, or health care operations.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may share a patient's medical records with another provider to facilitate treatment, ensuring compliance with the established regulations. A hospital may use patient information for billing purposes, such as submitting claims to insurance companies, as long as it aligns with the permitted uses outlined in the regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of safeguarding patient privacy while allowing necessary information flow for healthcare delivery. It supports the overall framework of HIPAA by balancing patient rights with the operational needs of healthcare providers, ensuring that PHI is handled appropriately.
