# Law
164.508(c)(2)(ii)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
The prohibition on conditioning authorizations ensures that individuals cannot be coerced into providing consent for the disclosure of their health information in order to receive necessary medical treatment or benefits. The concept of covered entities refers to organizations or individuals that handle protected health information and are subject to regulations governing its use and disclosure.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of informed consent mandates that individuals should not be forced to sign authorizations as a condition for receiving healthcare services or benefits. The principle of non-discrimination ensures that individuals receive equal access to treatment and benefits irrespective of their willingness to authorize the release of their health information.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider must provide treatment for a patient regardless of whether the patient signs a release for their medical records to be shared with insurers. A health insurance company cannot deny enrollment or benefits to an individual who refuses to sign an authorization for the release of their health information.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the overarching goal of protecting patient autonomy and privacy in healthcare by preventing coercive practices related to authorizations. It supports the broader regulatory framework that governs how health information is shared, ensuring that patients are not penalized for exercising their rights regarding their personal health data.
