# Law
164.502(a)(5)(ii)(B)(2)(iv)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. Covered Entity: A person or entity that provides health care services or transactions that are regulated under HIPAA, including health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. Health Care Operations: Activities related to the administration of a health care entity, including quality assessment, case management, and conducting training programs.
# Key Legal Principles
Permitted Uses and Disclosures: Covered entities may use or disclose PHI for treatment, payment, or health care operations without obtaining patient authorization, provided compliance with specific regulations. Sale of PHI: The law outlines that the sale of PHI is distinct from other disclosures, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding patient information during business transactions like mergers.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider undergoing a merger with another facility must ensure that any PHI transferred complies with the legal standards for permitted disclosures. During a business acquisition, due diligence may involve the review of PHI, which must be conducted in accordance with HIPAA regulations to prevent unauthorized access.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law underscores the necessity of regulatory compliance when handling PHI during significant business transactions, protecting patient privacy while allowing for business continuity. The provision reinforces the balance between operational needs of health care entities and the imperative to maintain confidentiality and security of sensitive health information.
