# Law
164.504(e)(2)(ii)(G)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Business Associate**: A person or entity that performs activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to a specific individual. **Accounting of Disclosures**: A requirement under HIPAA that allows individuals to know when and to whom their PHI has been disclosed by a covered entity or business associate.
# Key Legal Principles
**Transparency**: Entities must be transparent about how PHI is shared and disclosed, ensuring individuals can access information about their health data. **Accountability**: Business associates are accountable for safeguarding PHI and providing necessary information to covered entities for compliance with HIPAA regulations.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may need to request a business associate to prepare a report detailing all disclosures of PHI to comply with a patientâ€™s request for an accounting. A health insurance company might need to ensure its business associates can provide the necessary information for audits regarding PHI disclosures.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the obligations of business associates to support compliance with HIPAA's accounting requirements, reinforcing the framework of accountability in health information management. It establishes a clear expectation that business associates must be prepared to supply documentation necessary for covered entities to fulfill their legal obligations regarding PHI disclosures.
