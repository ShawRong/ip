# Law
164.510(a)(1)(i)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any information that relates to an individual's health condition, treatment, or payment that can be used to identify the individual. The law specifies that PHI must be handled with care to protect patient privacy. Directory Information: This concept involves maintaining a directory of individuals within a healthcare facility, which can include their location. It is crucial for operational purposes but must be balanced with patient confidentiality.
# Key Legal Principles
Patient Consent: Healthcare providers must obtain consent from individuals to use their PHI for directory purposes. This principle ensures that patients have control over their personal information. Minimum Necessary Rule: When using PHI, healthcare providers must limit the information to only what is necessary for the purpose. This principle is designed to protect patient privacy by not disclosing more information than needed.
# Application Scenarios
A hospital may maintain a directory that includes the names and room numbers of patients, allowing visitors to find their loved ones while ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to this information. A healthcare provider might use directory information to facilitate communication among staff, ensuring that they can locate patients efficiently without compromising their privacy.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of an individual's location in the directory aligns with the broader goal of facilitating patient care while adhering to privacy regulations. This provision underscores the importance of balancing operational needs of healthcare facilities with the legal obligation to protect patient privacy and maintain confidentiality.
