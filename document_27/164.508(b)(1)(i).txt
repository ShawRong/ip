# Law
164.508(b)(1)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
A valid authorization is a legal document that grants permission for specific uses and disclosures of protected health information (PHI) under defined conditions. The concept of financial remuneration in marketing contexts requires explicit acknowledgment in the authorization, ensuring transparency regarding any compensation received by the covered entity.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of informed consent mandates that individuals must be adequately informed about the nature and consequences of their authorization, including any financial aspects. The principle of specificity requires that authorizations outline the precise uses and disclosures of PHI, ensuring that individuals understand what they are consenting to.
# Application Scenarios
In a healthcare marketing campaign where a third party compensates a provider for promoting a medication, the provider must obtain a valid authorization that explicitly states the involvement of remuneration. A hospital seeking to share patient data with a research organization must ensure that the authorization includes core elements and required statements as per the regulations, particularly if the hospital stands to gain financially.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law reinforces the necessity of obtaining valid authorizations that comply with specific regulatory requirements, thereby protecting patient rights and promoting transparency in health information practices. It underscores the importance of detailed disclosures in authorizations, which align with broader regulatory goals of safeguarding patient privacy while allowing for necessary marketing and research activities.
