# Law
164.508(b)(5)(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
Revocation of authorization: This refers to an individual's right to withdraw consent for a covered entity to use or disclose their protected health information (PHI) at any time, provided it is done in writing. Reliance on authorization: This concept addresses the situation where a covered entity has acted based on the authorization provided by the individual, which may affect the ability to revoke that authorization.
# Key Legal Principles
Written revocation requirement: The law stipulates that revocations must be documented in writing to be effective, ensuring clarity and formal acknowledgment of the individual's intent. Effect of reliance: If a covered entity has already taken action based on the original authorization, the revocation may not retroactively affect those actions, protecting the entity from legal repercussions.
# Application Scenarios
A patient decides to revoke their consent for a healthcare provider to share their medical records with a third party after treatment has already begun. A researcher must discontinue a study involving patient data when consent is revoked, unless they have already published findings based on that data.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision underscores the balance between individual rights to control their health information and the operational realities faced by covered entities that rely on those authorizations. It emphasizes the importance of written communication in legal processes involving personal health information, which is crucial for compliance and accountability.
