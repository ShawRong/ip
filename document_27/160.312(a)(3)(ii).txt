# Law
160.312(a)(3)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Civil Money Penalty: This refers to a financial penalty imposed by a regulatory authority on entities that violate specific legal provisions, often as a deterrent against non-compliance. Notice of Proposed Determination: This is a formal notification issued by the Secretary that outlines the findings regarding a violation and the proposed penalties, allowing the affected party to understand the basis for the action taken.
# Key Legal Principles
Due Process: The legal principle that ensures individuals and entities have the right to receive notice of actions taken against them and the opportunity to respond or defend themselves. Right to Mitigate: The principle that allows covered entities or business associates the opportunity to present mitigating factors or defenses before a penalty is finalized.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider receives a notice from the Secretary indicating potential violations of privacy regulations and is informed of a proposed civil money penalty, prompting them to gather evidence to contest the findings. A business associate discovers that they have inadvertently breached regulations and, upon receiving a notice of proposed determination, prepares a written response to submit mitigating circumstances to the Secretary.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision emphasizes the procedural fairness involved in imposing penalties, reinforcing the importance of notification and the opportunity for entities to present their case. It illustrates the sequential steps in regulatory enforcement, where informal resolutions are prioritized, followed by formal actions if necessary, thus framing the overall compliance and accountability framework.
