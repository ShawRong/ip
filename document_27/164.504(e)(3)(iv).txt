164.504(e)(3)(iv)
# Key Legal Concepts
Covered Entity: A health care provider, health plan, or health care clearinghouse that transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. Business Associate: An individual or entity that performs functions on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Limited Data Set: A set of data that excludes certain direct identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual, allowing for the use of some health information while protecting privacy. Data Use Agreement (DUA): A formal agreement that outlines the permissible uses and disclosures of a limited data set, ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.
# Key Legal Principles
Compliance: Covered entities must ensure that any disclosures of PHI to business associates are compliant with HIPAA regulations, specifically through appropriate contracts and agreements. Privacy: The principle of protecting individual privacy is paramount, necessitating the use of limited data sets and data use agreements to minimize exposure of PHI. Accountability: Covered entities are responsible for the actions of their business associates regarding the handling of PHI, emphasizing the need for formal agreements that specify responsibilities.
# Application Scenarios
A hospital discloses a limited data set to a research firm to analyze health trends, ensuring a data use agreement is in place to govern the use of that data. A health insurance company shares a limited data set with a third-party vendor for administrative functions, adhering to the requirements set forth in the applicable laws.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of structured agreements and compliance measures when handling sensitive health information, thereby reinforcing the overarching goals of HIPAA to protect patient privacy. It highlights the necessity of limited data sets as a method to balance the need for health care operations with the imperative of safeguarding individual health information.
