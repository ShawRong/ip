# Law
164.500(b)(1)(iv)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI):** Any individually identifiable health information that is held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associates, in any form, whether electronic, paper, or oral. **Health Care Clearinghouse:** An entity that processes health information received from another entity and facilitates the transfer of PHI between covered entities, often acting as a business associate.
# Key Legal Principles
**Compliance Requirement:** Health care clearinghouses must adhere to organizational requirements set forth in Section 164.504, which governs how covered entities handle PHI and mandates appropriate safeguards. **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs):** When a clearinghouse acts as a business associate, it must enter into a BAA with the covered entity, ensuring compliance with HIPAA standards regarding PHI.
# Application Scenarios
A health care clearinghouse receives patient data from a hospital for billing purposes, necessitating compliance with Section 164.504 to ensure that the information is protected and used appropriately. A health care clearinghouse must implement safeguards and training programs to ensure that its employees understand and comply with HIPAA requirements when processing PHI.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
Section 164.500(b)(1) emphasizes the importance of compliance for entities handling PHI, reinforcing the necessity for clearinghouses to follow organizational guidelines outlined in Section 164.504. The linkage between these sections underscores the regulatory framework designed to protect patient information and ensure accountability among entities dealing with PHI.
