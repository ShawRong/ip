# Law
160.104(c)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
Compliance Date: This is the date by which entities must adhere to a specific standard or implementation specification. It is essential for ensuring that organizations transition to new regulations in a timely manner. Modification of Standards: Refers to the process wherein the Secretary can alter existing standards or specifications, which may impact compliance requirements for health plans.
# Key Legal Principles
Discretionary Authority: The Secretary has the authority to extend compliance dates, particularly for small health plans, which allows for flexibility in regulation enforcement. Equity in Compliance: The provision recognizes the unique challenges faced by smaller health plans, ensuring they are not disproportionately burdened by compliance requirements compared to larger entities.
# Application Scenarios
A small health plan that lacks the resources to meet a new standard by the original compliance date may seek an extension from the Secretary to allow additional time for compliance. During a regulatory overhaul, the Secretary might assess the capabilities of small health plans and decide to extend compliance dates to facilitate smoother transitions.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision supports the overall framework of regulatory flexibility, highlighting the need for tailored compliance timelines based on the size and capacity of health plans. It underscores the government's role in balancing regulatory requirements with the practical realities faced by smaller entities in the healthcare landscape.
