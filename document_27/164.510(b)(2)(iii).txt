# Law
164.510(b)(2)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any health information that can be linked to an individual, which is protected under privacy laws. The law stipulates conditions under which PHI can be disclosed. **Covered Entity**: This term refers to healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that are subject to privacy regulations regarding the handling of PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
**Informed Consent**: The principle that individuals must be informed and give consent before their health information can be disclosed, except in certain circumstances. **Professional Judgment**: The requirement for healthcare professionals to use their discretion and judgment when determining whether an individual would object to the disclosure of their information.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may discuss a patient's treatment plan with family members present, assuming the patient does not object to this sharing of information. In a case where a patient is in a shared hospital room, a doctor may disclose relevant health information to another healthcare worker if it is reasonably inferred that the patient does not object.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision supports the overarching goal of patient autonomy and privacy by ensuring that disclosures are made only when it is reasonable to assume that the patient consents. It reinforces the importance of professional judgment in maintaining ethical standards while facilitating effective communication in healthcare settings.
