# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entities**: Organizations such as health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that are required to comply with privacy regulations regarding protected health information (PHI). **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any individually identifiable health information that is transmitted or maintained in any form, which is subject to privacy protections under the law. **Business Associates**: Individuals or entities that perform functions on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of PHI, and are therefore also subject to certain privacy standards.
# Key Legal Principles
