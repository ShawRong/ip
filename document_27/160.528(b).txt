# Key Legal Concepts
Written Motions: This concept emphasizes that most motions in legal proceedings must be submitted in written form, ensuring clarity and a formal record. Oral Motions: Occasionally, oral motions may be permitted, but they must be documented if the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) requires it, highlighting the importance of maintaining a written record.
# Key Legal Principles
Formality of Proceedings: The requirement for written motions underscores the principle that legal processes must adhere to formal procedures to ensure fairness and transparency. Judicial Discretion: The ALJ's ability to require oral motions to be reduced to writing illustrates the principle of judicial discretion, allowing for flexibility within established rules.
# Application Scenarios
A party wishing to file a motion for summary judgment must submit their motion in writing to comply with the law. During a prehearing conference, a party may make an oral motion, but if the ALJ deems it necessary, they must submit a written version afterward.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision reinforces the structured nature of legal proceedings, which is essential for maintaining order and ensuring that all parties are adequately informed. It supports the broader argument for procedural fairness in administrative hearings, ensuring that motions are properly documented and accessible for review.
