Data Use Agreement: A contract that outlines the permitted uses and disclosures of a limited data set, ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations.
# Key Legal Principles
Good Faith Effort: Covered entities must make a reasonable attempt to obtain assurances from business associates regarding the compliance and protection of PHI. Legal Mandate Exception: Covered entities may disclose PHI to business associates without meeting certain HIPAA requirements if required by law, provided they document their efforts to obtain assurances. Termination Authorization Flexibility: If statutory obligations conflict with required termination authorizations, such authorizations may be omitted from arrangements. Compliance through Limited Data Sets: Covered entities can comply with HIPAA provisions by disclosing only limited data sets under proper agreements.
# Application Scenarios
