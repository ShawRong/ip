# Law
164.508(b)(6)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entity**: A covered entity refers to organizations and individuals that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that transmit health information electronically. **Authorization**: An authorization is a specific permission granted by a patient or client allowing a covered entity to use or disclose protected health information (PHI) for purposes other than treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.
# Key Legal Principles
**Documentation Requirement**: The principle that covered entities must document and retain signed authorizations as a means of accountability and compliance with HIPAA regulations, ensuring that patients' consent is verifiable and accessible. **Retention Policies**: Covered entities are required to establish policies regarding how long to retain documentation of authorizations, reflecting the need for proper record-keeping and the ability to address grievances or legal inquiries.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider must obtain a signed authorization from a patient before sharing their medical records with a third party, such as a research organization, and must keep that authorization on file for future reference. A health insurance company needs to document patient authorizations for disclosing PHI to other insurers for coordination of benefits, ensuring compliance with HIPAA and protecting patient rights.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The requirement for documentation under ยง 164.508(b)(6) reinforces the broader argument of patient rights and privacy in the context of HIPAA, emphasizing the importance of informed consent in health information management. By linking the documentation of authorizations to the requirements in ยง 164.530(j), the law underscores the interconnectedness of various HIPAA provisions aimed at safeguarding patient information and ensuring ethical practices in healthcare.
