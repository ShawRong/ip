# Law
164.510(a)(3)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any individually identifiable health information that is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium, which is protected under privacy laws. Opportunity to Object: The right of an individual to be informed about the uses and disclosures of their PHI and to restrict or prohibit certain disclosures, particularly in the context of directories.
# Key Legal Principles
Informed Consent: Health care providers are required to inform individuals about how their PHI may be used or disclosed, ensuring that patients can make informed decisions regarding their personal health information. Patient Autonomy: This principle emphasizes the individual's right to make decisions about their own health information, including the ability to object to certain uses or disclosures.
# Application Scenarios
A patient may want to ensure that their religious affiliation is not disclosed to anyone without their explicit consent, thus exercising their right to object to certain disclosures. In an emergency situation, a health care provider may disclose information without prior consent, but must inform the patient afterward and provide an opportunity to object when feasible.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law reinforces the importance of patient control over their health information, aligning with broader privacy regulations aimed at protecting individuals' rights. It establishes a procedural requirement for health care providers, ensuring they uphold ethical standards in patient communication and consent.
