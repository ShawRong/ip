# Law
164.504(e)(4)(i)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
Business Associate: A business associate is a person or entity that performs functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Protected Health Information (PHI): PHI refers to any information held by a covered entity that can be used to identify an individual and relates to their health condition, healthcare provision, or payment for healthcare.
# Key Legal Principles
Permissible Use: The law allows business associates to use PHI for specified purposes, such as proper management and administration, as long as these uses are outlined in a contract or arrangement with the covered entity. Contractual Obligations: The relationship between a covered entity and a business associate must be governed by a contract that specifies the permitted uses and disclosures of PHI, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare management firm that analyzes patient data for a hospital may use PHI to improve service delivery, provided this use is detailed in their agreement. A billing service may access PHI to process claims for a healthcare provider, ensuring that such use is necessary for the administration of their business.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the importance of clearly defined roles and responsibilities in handling PHI between covered entities and business associates, which is critical for maintaining patient privacy. It supports the overall framework of health information privacy regulations by outlining the conditions under which PHI can be used, thus balancing operational needs with privacy protections.
