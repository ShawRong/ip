# Law
164.508(b)(4)(ii)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Psychotherapy Notes**: These are notes recorded by a mental health professional during a therapy session. They are distinct from other health information and generally require specific authorization for use or disclosure. **Authorization Requirements**: Covered entities must obtain explicit permission from individuals before using or disclosing psychotherapy notes, ensuring patient privacy and control over sensitive information.
# Key Legal Principles
**Informed Consent**: Individuals must be fully informed about what they are authorizing when it comes to their psychotherapy notes, reinforcing the principle of autonomy in healthcare. **Limitation of Disclosure**: The law emphasizes that psychotherapy notes should not be disclosed without proper authorization, protecting the confidentiality of patient-therapist communications.
# Application Scenarios
A mental health provider must obtain written consent from a patient before sharing their psychotherapy notes with another healthcare provider. A health plan may request authorization for access to psychotherapy notes, but must clarify that this authorization is separate from other health information disclosures.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of specific provisions regarding psychotherapy notes highlights the emphasis on protecting sensitive mental health information in the broader framework of health privacy laws. This law reinforces the importance of patient rights in the context of mental health treatment, aligning with the overall goals of the document to safeguard individual privacy.
