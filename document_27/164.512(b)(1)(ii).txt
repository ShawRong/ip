164.512(b)(1)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Permitted disclosures: This concept refers to the specific circumstances under which a covered entity, such as healthcare providers, can disclose protected health information (PHI) without violating privacy laws, particularly in the context of public health and safety. Child abuse reporting: This concept highlights the legal obligation to report suspected child abuse or neglect to designated authorities, ensuring the protection of vulnerable individuals.
# Key Legal Principles
Confidentiality vs. Reporting Obligations: This principle balances the need to maintain patient confidentiality with the obligation to report certain information to protect public health or safety, particularly concerning children. Authority to Act: This principle emphasizes that only authorized entities, such as public health authorities or social services, can receive reports of child abuse or neglect, reinforcing the legal framework surrounding such disclosures.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider suspects a child is being abused and discloses relevant PHI to a child protection agency as mandated by law. A hospital reports a case of suspected child neglect to the appropriate government authority, ensuring legal compliance and safeguarding the child's welfare.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law establishes a clear mandate for reporting child abuse and neglect, reinforcing the importance of protecting children while maintaining the integrity of health information privacy. It situates the responsibility of covered entities within the broader context of public health and safety, illustrating the legal framework that governs disclosures of sensitive information.
