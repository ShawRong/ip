# Law
164.506(c)(5)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entity**: A covered entity refers to any organization or individual that transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. This includes health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: PHI includes any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. This law governs how such information can be shared. **Organized Health Care Arrangement**: This is a group of health care providers that come together to provide health care services, allowing them to share patient information for coordinated care.
# Key Legal Principles
**Permissive Disclosure**: The law allows covered entities to disclose PHI to other participants in an organized health care arrangement, emphasizing the permissive nature of such disclosures for health care operations. **Health Care Operations**: This principle includes a range of activities such as quality assessment, improvement activities, and conducting training programs for staff, which are essential for the functioning of health care organizations.
# Application Scenarios
A hospital that collaborates with a network of specialists can share patient information among the specialists to ensure coordinated care and treatment planning. A health insurance company may share PHI with a hospital for the purpose of conducting quality reviews and operational audits.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
By permitting disclosures among participants in organized health care arrangements, the law supports the integration and efficiency of health care delivery, which is crucial for patient care improvement. This provision illustrates the balance between patient privacy and the need for effective health care operations, reinforcing the regulatory framework established by HIPAA.
