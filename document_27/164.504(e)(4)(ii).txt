# Law
164.504(e)(4)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any health information that can identify an individual and is held by a covered entity or business associate. The law regulates how this information can be used and disclosed. **Business Associate**: An entity or person that performs functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of PHI. The relationship is governed by a contract that outlines permissible uses and disclosures.
# Key Legal Principles
**Permissive Disclosure**: The law allows business associates to disclose PHI under specific conditions, such as when required by law or for specific permitted purposes outlined in the contract with the covered entity. **Contractual Obligations**: The contract between the covered entity and the business associate must clearly define the circumstances under which PHI can be shared, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider (covered entity) engages a billing company (business associate) to manage patient billing. The contract must specify that the billing company can use PHI for billing purposes and disclose it only as permitted by law. A software vendor (business associate) develops a health management system for a hospital (covered entity). The contract allows the vendor to access and use PHI only for the purpose of system maintenance and compliance with health regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This section reinforces the need for clear contractual relationships between covered entities and business associates, ensuring that PHI is handled responsibly and in compliance with legal requirements. It emphasizes the importance of lawful disclosures of PHI, which is essential for maintaining privacy while allowing necessary healthcare operations to continue.
