# Law
164.504(e)(3)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Termination Authorization: This refers to the right of a covered entity to end a contract with a business associate if the associate violates a significant term of the contract. Statutory Obligations: These are legal requirements that govern the actions of covered entities and their business associates, potentially affecting their contractual agreements.
# Key Legal Principles
Material Violation Principle: A covered entity can terminate a contract based on the violation of material terms, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the core obligations outlined in the contract. Inconsistency Clause: This principle allows for flexibility in the enforcement of termination rights, recognizing that statutory obligations may override contractual terms.
# Application Scenarios
A covered entity discovers that a business associate has mishandled protected health information (PHI), constituting a material violation, and decides to terminate the contract based on this breach. A business associate is bound by new statutory regulations that conflict with the termination clause in their contract with a covered entity, leading to a situation where the termination authorization cannot be enforced.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law underscores the balance between contractual rights and statutory obligations, ensuring that entities operate within legal frameworks while maintaining contractual integrity. It highlights the necessity for covered entities to navigate both their contractual agreements and their legal duties, promoting compliance and accountability in health information management.
