# Law
164.504(e)(2)(ii)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
Business Associate: A person or entity that performs certain functions on behalf of or provides services to a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Protected Health Information (PHI): Any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual.
# Key Legal Principles
Confidentiality Principle: Business associates must maintain the confidentiality of PHI and may only use or disclose it as permitted by the contract or required by law. Compliance Obligation: Business associates are legally bound to adhere to the terms outlined in contracts that govern the handling of PHI, ensuring they operate within legal frameworks.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider contracts with a third-party billing service, which must only use patient information as outlined in the contract and not for any unauthorized purposes. A cloud storage provider stores PHI for a hospital and must ensure that the information is not disclosed to unauthorized parties, adhering strictly to the contractual agreements.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the accountability of business associates in safeguarding PHI, reinforcing the need for stringent privacy measures in healthcare transactions. It establishes a legal framework that protects patient information, which is crucial for maintaining trust in healthcare systems and ensuring compliance with broader privacy regulations.
