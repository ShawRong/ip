# Law
164.512(a)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any individually identifiable health information that is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium. It is crucial to understand that PHI is subject to privacy regulations under the law. Covered Entity: This term includes health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. Covered entities have specific obligations regarding the handling of PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
Compliance with Legal Requirements: The law emphasizes that any use or disclosure of PHI must not only be required by law but also comply with the specific requirements set forth in that law. This principle ensures that disclosures are made lawfully and with respect for patient privacy. Limitation Principle: The use or disclosure of PHI must be limited to the minimum necessary information required to satisfy the legal obligation. This principle aims to reduce the risk of unnecessary exposure of PHI.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may disclose patient information to comply with a state law requiring reporting of certain infectious diseases to public health authorities. A health plan might be compelled to provide information to a regulatory agency during an audit, provided the disclosure aligns with the legal requirements.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law underscores the importance of balancing legal obligations with the protection of patient privacy, reinforcing the need for covered entities to navigate compliance carefully. It establishes a framework within which covered entities must operate, highlighting that legal requirements must be adhered to while still respecting patient confidentiality.
