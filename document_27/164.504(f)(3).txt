# Law
164.504(f)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. The law emphasizes the protection of PHI in the context of group health plans. Plan Sponsor: A plan sponsor is typically the employer or organization that establishes and maintains a group health plan. The law outlines specific conditions under which PHI can be disclosed to these sponsors.
# Key Legal Principles
Permissible Disclosures: The law specifies that PHI may only be disclosed to plan sponsors for plan administration functions, aligning with strict regulatory provisions to ensure confidentiality. Restrictions on Use: There are explicit prohibitions against using PHI for employment-related actions or decisions, reinforcing the principle of safeguarding individual privacy within health plan contexts.
# Application Scenarios
A health insurance issuer accessing PHI to administer a group health plan must comply with the specified conditions, ensuring that any disclosure is strictly for administrative functions. A plan sponsor seeking to use PHI for purposes other than those outlined in the law must refrain from such actions to comply with regulations, particularly regarding employee-related decisions.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law reinforces the commitment to protecting individual health information while allowing necessary administrative functions to be performed by plan sponsors. By delineating clear boundaries for the use and disclosure of PHI, the law supports the broader goal of maintaining confidentiality and trust in health care systems.
