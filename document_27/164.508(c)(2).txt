# Law
164.508(c)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
The concept of 'valid authorization' is crucial, as it establishes the necessary criteria a document must meet to be legally recognized for the disclosure of protected information. The 'right to revoke authorization' highlights the individual's control over their personal information, allowing them to withdraw consent at any time. The 'condition of treatment or payment' refers to whether the provision of healthcare services can be contingent upon the individual providing authorization for information disclosure. The 'potential for redisclosure' emphasizes that once information is shared, it may be further disclosed by the recipient, potentially leading to a loss of confidentiality.
# Key Legal Principles
Transparency: Individuals must be adequately informed about the implications of their authorization for information disclosure. Consent: The principle of informed consent requires that individuals understand what they are agreeing to when signing an authorization. Autonomy: This principle underscores the importance of individual choice regarding personal health information and its dissemination. Accountability: Entities that handle personal information must be responsible for the protection of that information and inform individuals of their rights.
# Application Scenarios
A patient signing an authorization form to allow their healthcare provider to share their medical history with a specialist. A client revoking previous consent for their insurance company to access certain health records after receiving treatment.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The requirements outlined in section 164.508(c)(2) support the overarching goal of protecting individual privacy in healthcare by ensuring that authorizations are clear and comprehensive. By mandating specific statements, the law reinforces the need for informed consent and empowers individuals to make knowledgeable decisions regarding their personal health information.
