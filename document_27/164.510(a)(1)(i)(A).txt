# Law
164.510(a)(1)(i)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. The law emphasizes the use of such information in a manner that respects individuals' privacy rights. Directory Maintenance: This concept involves the lawful use of an individual's identifying information to create and manage a directory within a healthcare facility, ensuring that only necessary and appropriate information is included.
# Key Legal Principles
Consent and Authorization: The law mandates that individuals must be informed about how their health information is used and gives them the opportunity to consent to its use in directories. This principle underscores the importance of patient autonomy. Minimum Necessary Standard: This principle requires that only the least amount of personal information necessary for the intended purpose (in this case, maintaining a directory) should be used or disclosed. This helps to protect individuals' privacy.
# Application Scenarios
Healthcare facilities can use the individual's name to create a directory that helps staff, visitors, and emergency responders locate patients, provided that this practice complies with privacy regulations. During patient admission, healthcare providers must ensure that patients are informed about the directory and their rights regarding their information, allowing them to opt-out if they choose.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of the individual's name in the directory supports the operational needs of healthcare facilities while balancing the need for privacy, demonstrating compliance with privacy laws. This law serves as a foundational element in the broader context of patient rights and healthcare compliance, reinforcing the importance of safeguarding PHI in all administrative practices.
