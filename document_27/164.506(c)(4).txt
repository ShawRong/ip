# Law
164.506(c)(4)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any individually identifiable health information that is transmitted or maintained in any form or medium, which is protected under privacy regulations. Covered Entity: An entity that is subject to HIPAA regulations, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that transmit any health information in electronic form. Health Care Operations: Activities related to the administration and management of a healthcare entity, including quality assessment, case management, and fraud detection.
# Key Legal Principles
Permissive Disclosure: The law allows covered entities to disclose PHI to other covered entities for health care operations, provided certain conditions are met. Relational Context: The disclosure is permissible only if both entities have a relationship with the individual whose PHI is being disclosed, ensuring that the information pertains specifically to that relationship. Compliance with Regulations: The principle underscores the importance of adhering to HIPAA regulations while facilitating necessary healthcare operations.
# Application Scenarios

# Relationship to Overall Document Argument

It supports the overarching goal of HIPAA to protect patient information while allowing necessary disclosures that enhance healthcare delivery and compliance efforts.
