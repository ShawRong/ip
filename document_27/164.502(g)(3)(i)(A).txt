# Law
164.502(g)(3)(i)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
Unemancipated minors: Refers to individuals who are under the age of majority and do not have the legal capacity to make certain decisions independently, particularly in health care. Personal representative: A person who is authorized to act on behalf of another individual, in this case, a parent, guardian, or person in loco parentis, regarding the individual's health care decisions.
# Key Legal Principles
Consent: The minor's consent is sufficient for certain health care services, meaning no further consent is required from a parent or guardian under the specified conditions. Professional judgment: Health care professionals must exercise their judgment in determining access to the minor's health information, particularly when the status of the personal representative is unclear.
# Application Scenarios
A minor seeks treatment for a health issue and consents to the procedure without needing parental consent, ensuring that no other individual can override their decision. A healthcare provider must determine whether to grant access to the minor's health information to a parent or guardian, based on the professional judgment and applicable laws.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the autonomy of minors in specific health care decisions, balancing their rights against the interests of parents or guardians. It clarifies the circumstances under which a parent or guardian may act as a personal representative, ensuring that minors have a say in their health care while still providing protective measures.
