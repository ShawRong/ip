# Law
164.508(a)(3)(i)(A)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This concept refers to any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. Authorization Requirement: This principle mandates that covered entities must obtain explicit permission from individuals before using or disclosing their PHI for marketing purposes, with specific exceptions.
# Key Legal Principles
Consent: The necessity for obtaining consent underscores the importance of individual autonomy and privacy regarding personal health information. Scope of Marketing: The law delineates what constitutes marketing and specifies circumstances under which authorization is not required, ensuring clarity in the use of PHI.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider wanting to promote a new health service must obtain authorization from patients before using their PHI for marketing purposes. A face-to-face meeting between a healthcare professional and a patient, wherein information is shared about a new treatment option, qualifies as an exception and does not require prior authorization.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision supports the broader regulatory framework aimed at protecting patient privacy while allowing for certain types of communication that are less intrusive. It emphasizes the balance between healthcare marketing and patient rights, ensuring that marketing practices do not compromise individuals' control over their health information.
