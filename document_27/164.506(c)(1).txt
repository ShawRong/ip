# Law
164.506(c)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entity**: A covered entity is defined under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) as a health care provider, health plan, or health care clearinghouse that transmits any health information in electronic form. These entities are subject to specific regulations regarding the handling of protected health information (PHI). **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: PHI refers to any individually identifiable health information that is held by a covered entity, which includes any information that can be used to identify an individual and relates to their health, healthcare provision, or payment for healthcare.
# Key Legal Principles
**Permitted Uses and Disclosures**: The principle here is that a covered entity is authorized to use or disclose PHI without patient consent for its own treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, thereby facilitating necessary health care functions. **Minimum Necessary Standard**: Although covered entities can use or disclose PHI for treatment, payment, or operations, they must adhere to the minimum necessary standard, meaning they should only use or disclose the amount of information needed to accomplish the intended purpose.
# Application Scenarios
**Treatment**: A physician may access a patient's medical records to provide appropriate care, such as accessing previous diagnoses or treatment plans. **Payment**: A hospital may share PHI with an insurance company to process a claim for services rendered to a patient.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
**Support for Patient Care**: This law emphasizes the importance of allowing covered entities to access and use PHI to ensure effective patient care and the smooth operation of healthcare services. **Balancing Privacy and Access**: While the law permits certain uses and disclosures of PHI, it also establishes boundaries to protect patient privacy, ensuring that information is not used indiscriminately.
