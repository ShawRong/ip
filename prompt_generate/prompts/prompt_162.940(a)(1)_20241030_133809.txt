Prompt:
Identify the key legal concepts and principles related to the provided laws.
I will provide a context, which will follow the label "Context:"


Context: {'id': '162.940(a)', 'data': '(a) Requests for an exception.  An organization may request an exception from the use of a standard from the Secretary to test a proposed modification to that standard. For each proposed modification, the organization must meet the following requirements: '}, {'id': '162.940(a)(1)(i)', 'data': '(i) Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by leading to cost reductions for, or improvements in benefits from, electronic health care transactions. '}, {'id': '162.940(a)(1)(ii)', 'data': '(ii) Meet the needs of the health data standards user community, particularly health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses. '}, {'id': '162.940(a)(1)(iii)', 'data': '(iii) Be uniform and consistent with the other standards adopted under this part and, as appropriate, with other private and public sector health data standards. '}, {'id': '162.940(a)(1)(iv)', 'data': '(iv) Have low additional development and implementation costs relative to the benefits of using the standard.

'}, {'id': '162.940(a)(1)(viii)', 'data': '(viii) Be precise, unambiguous, and as simple as possible. '}, {'id': '162.940(a)(1)(ix)', 'data': '(ix) Result in minimum data collection and paperwork burdens on users. '}, {'id': '162.940(a)(1)(x)', 'data': '(x) Incorporate flexibility to adapt more easily to changes in the health care infrastructure (such as new services, organizations, and provider types) and information technology.
