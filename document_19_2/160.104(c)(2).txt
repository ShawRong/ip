# Law
160.104(c)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
The role of the Secretary in establishing compliance dates for modified standards or specifications is a key concept, indicating the authority and discretion vested in this position. The concept of compliance dates relates to the timeline by which entities must adhere to new or modified regulations, ensuring a structured approach to implementation.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of reasonableness is reflected in the Secretary's discretion to consider the extent of modifications and the time needed for compliance, promoting fair and manageable transitions for affected parties. The principle of flexibility in regulatory enforcement allows for adjustments based on practical considerations, ensuring that entities are not unduly burdened by sudden changes.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider must adjust its systems to comply with a modified standard. The Secretary evaluates how significant the changes are and sets a compliance date that allows sufficient time for the provider to adapt. A technology company developing software to meet new implementation specifications may request an extension based on the complexity of the modifications. The Secretary can then assess the situation and establish a reasonable compliance date.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the balance between regulatory oversight and practical implementation, supporting the argument that regulations should be adaptive to real-world conditions. It reinforces the notion that regulatory frameworks should not only impose standards but also consider the capacity of regulated entities to comply, fostering a cooperative regulatory environment.
