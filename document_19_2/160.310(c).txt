# Key Legal Concepts
**Access Rights**: Covered entities and business associates must allow the Secretary access to their facilities and records for compliance checks, emphasizing transparency and accountability in handling protected health information (PHI). **Exigent Circumstances**: The law permits the Secretary to access information without notice if there are urgent situations, such as the risk of document destruction, highlighting the importance of immediate compliance in critical scenarios. **Certification of Efforts**: If relevant information is held by another entity that refuses to provide it, the covered entity or business associate must certify their efforts to obtain it, demonstrating a commitment to compliance and cooperation.
# Key Legal Principles
**Compliance and Oversight**: The principle that covered entities and business associates are subject to oversight by the Secretary to ensure adherence to administrative simplification provisions. **Confidentiality of PHI**: The Secretary is restricted in disclosing PHI obtained during investigations, illustrating the balance between enforcement and the protection of sensitive health information. **Cooperation with Investigations**: Entities are required to cooperate with investigations, reinforcing the principle that compliance with health information regulations is mandatory.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider being audited by the Secretary must grant access to their records to verify compliance with HIPAA regulations. In a situation where a covered entity suspects that documents may be destroyed, the Secretary can immediately access those records to prevent obstruction of an investigation.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This section supports the overarching goal of ensuring that covered entities and business associates are held accountable for their handling of PHI, reinforcing the integrity of health information privacy laws. It establishes a clear framework for the Secretary's authority and the obligations of entities, which is crucial for maintaining compliance and protecting patient information.
