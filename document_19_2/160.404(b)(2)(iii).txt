# Law
160.404(b)(2)(iii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Willful neglect: This refers to a situation where an entity knowingly fails to comply with legal obligations, demonstrating a conscious disregard for the law. Correction period: The law allows for a 30-day window where a covered entity or business associate can rectify a violation after becoming aware of it, potentially mitigating penalties.
# Key Legal Principles
Proportionality of penalties: The law outlines specific monetary penalties based on the nature and timing of the violation, emphasizing a structured approach to enforcement. Mitigation of penalties: The provision for correcting violations within a specified timeframe suggests an emphasis on encouraging compliance rather than merely punishing infractions.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discovers a breach of patient data but corrects the violation within 30 days, thus potentially reducing penalties. A business associate realizes they failed to comply with privacy regulations and takes immediate corrective action, which may affect the penalty amount.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision reinforces the importance of accountability while providing an avenue for remediation, aligning with broader goals of promoting compliance in the healthcare sector. It illustrates a balance between enforcement and support for entities striving to rectify compliance issues, contributing to a culture of accountability.
