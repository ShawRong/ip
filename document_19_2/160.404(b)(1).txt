# Law
160.404(b)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty**: This refers to a monetary fine imposed by a governmental authority for violations of regulatory laws. It serves as a deterrent against non-compliance. **Violation Limitations**: The law establishes specific limits on how much can be penalized for violations, emphasizing the need for proportionality in penalties.
# Key Legal Principles
**Due Process**: The imposition of civil money penalties must adhere to principles of fairness and must be clearly defined, ensuring individuals are aware of the consequences of their actions. **Proportionality**: The law stipulates maximum amounts for penalties, ensuring that fines are proportionate to the severity and frequency of the violations.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider may face a civil money penalty for failing to comply with specific regulations, with the penalty capped at $100 for each individual violation. An entity that commits multiple identical violations within a calendar year could be subject to a cumulative penalty not exceeding $25,000.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The document argues for the need to regulate and impose penalties for non-compliance, emphasizing the importance of setting clear limits to avoid excessive punitive measures. By specifying that penalties cannot be imposed for violations occurring prior to February 18, 2009, the law underscores a temporal limitation that protects entities from retrospective punishment.
