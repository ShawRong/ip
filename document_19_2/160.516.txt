# Key Legal Concepts
Discovery: The process by which parties obtain information and evidence from each other before a hearing, aimed at ensuring that all relevant material is accessible for consideration. Relevance and Materiality: The requirement that requested documents must be pertinent to the issues being considered by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), ensuring that only useful information is exchanged.
# Key Legal Principles
Limited Scope of Discovery: The law restricts discovery methods to requests for document production, prohibiting other forms such as interrogatories or depositions, which helps streamline the process. Protection of Privileged Information: Certain documents, such as interview reports and privileged communications, are exempt from disclosure, safeguarding confidential information during the hearing process.
