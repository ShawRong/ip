# Law
160.103(Group%20health%20plan)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
Group health plan: A type of employee welfare benefit plan that provides medical care to employees and their dependents, which can be either insured or self-insured. Administration by a third party: This refers to the requirement that the group health plan is managed by an entity that is not the employer itself, which can impact the governance and operational aspects of the plan.
# Key Legal Principles
Employer responsibility: Employers are obligated to offer health benefits as part of employee welfare benefits under ERISA, but they can delegate administration to a third-party entity. Regulatory compliance: Both the employer and the third-party administrator must comply with applicable federal laws, including ERISA and the Public Health Service Act.
# Application Scenarios
A company contracts with an insurance provider to manage its group health plan, ensuring that employees have access to medical care without the employer directly handling claims and reimbursements. A non-profit organization establishes a group health plan and hires a third-party administrator to ensure compliance with ERISA regulations and to manage employee enrollment and benefits.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision highlights the importance of third-party administration in ensuring that group health plans operate effectively and comply with legal requirements. It underscores the separation of roles between employers and administrators, emphasizing that while employers provide the plan, the execution and compliance can be managed externally.
