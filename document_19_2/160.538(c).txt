# Key Legal Concepts
**Interrogation Control**: The law emphasizes the importance of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) having authority to manage how witnesses are questioned, which is vital for maintaining order and efficiency during hearings. **Truth Ascertainment**: The primary goal of the interrogation process is to uncover the truth. This concept underlines the necessity for effective questioning techniques to elicit accurate information from witnesses.
# Key Legal Principles
**Efficiency**: The principle of avoiding repetition and unnecessary delays during witness interrogation is crucial. This ensures that the proceedings are conducted in a timely manner, which is beneficial for all parties involved. **Witness Protection**: Protecting witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment is a fundamental principle. It aims to create a safe environment for witnesses to provide their testimonies without fear of intimidation.
# Application Scenarios
During a hearing, an ALJ might limit the number of times a witness is questioned on the same issue to prevent redundancy and maintain focus on critical facts. In cases where a witness appears distressed, the ALJ may intervene to ensure that the questioning does not cause undue embarrassment or harassment.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions outlined in ยง 160.538 support the overall goal of fair and just administrative proceedings by ensuring that witness interrogations are conducted in a manner conducive to discovering the truth. The emphasis on controlling the interrogation process reflects a broader commitment to procedural fairness, enhancing the integrity of the legal process.
