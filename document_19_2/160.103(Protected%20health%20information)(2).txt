# Law
160.103(Protected%20health%20information)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected health information (PHI) refers to health data that can identify an individual, which is crucial for privacy protections under health laws. Exclusions from PHI are defined to clarify what information does not fall under the privacy protections, ensuring that certain contexts or types of information are not subject to the same legal standards.
# Key Legal Principles
Individual identification is a core principle, emphasizing that only information that can be linked to a specific person is considered protected. The integration of other laws, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), highlights the importance of context in determining the applicability of health information protections.
# Application Scenarios
An educational institution must navigate how it handles student health records, ensuring compliance with both FERPA and health privacy laws. An employer must consider how it stores and processes employee health information, balancing employee privacy with workplace health requirements.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The exclusions outlined in the law help delineate the scope of protections, reinforcing the intent to safeguard health information while allowing for necessary disclosures. The relationship between PHI and other regulatory frameworks illustrates a comprehensive approach to privacy, acknowledging the need for specific guidelines across different types of information.
