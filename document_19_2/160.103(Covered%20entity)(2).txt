160.103(Covered%20entity)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
A covered entity refers to any organization or person that transmits health information in electronic form in connection with a health care transaction. A health care clearinghouse is a type of covered entity that processes or facilitates the processing of health information received from another entity.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of confidentiality mandates that covered entities, including health care clearinghouses, protect the privacy of individuals' health information. The principle of compliance requires covered entities to adhere to specific regulations and standards set forth in laws such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).
# Application Scenarios
A health care clearinghouse may be used to standardize medical billing and ensure that claims are processed correctly between health care providers and insurers. When a health care provider sends patient data to an insurance company, the clearinghouse acts as an intermediary, ensuring that the data is formatted and transmitted in compliance with regulatory requirements.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The inclusion of health care clearinghouses as covered entities emphasizes the importance of controlling health information flow and ensuring its integrity. Recognizing health care clearinghouses as covered entities supports the overarching goals of privacy protection and data security within the health care system.
