160.404(b)(2)(iv)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Willful Neglect**: This refers to a conscious, intentional disregard for the rules or regulations, indicating that the entity was aware of the violation but chose not to correct it. **Civil Money Penalty**: This is a financial penalty imposed by the Secretary for violations, which is structured according to specific thresholds for minimum and maximum amounts.
# Key Legal Principles
**Strict Liability for Non-Correction**: Entities are held strictly liable if they fail to correct violations within a specified period after becoming aware of them, emphasizing the importance of timely compliance. **Graduated Penalties**: The law outlines specific minimum and maximum amounts for penalties based on the nature of the violation, reflecting a structured approach to enforcement.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider discovers a data breach but does not take corrective action within 30 days, resulting in a substantial penalty due to willful neglect. A business associate fails to address a compliance issue after it is identified during an audit, leading to financial penalties for ongoing violations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law underscores the importance of proactive compliance and accountability by imposing significant penalties for willful neglect, reinforcing regulatory standards. It establishes a framework for enforcement that balances the need for deterrence with the opportunity for entities to rectify violations before penalties escalate.
