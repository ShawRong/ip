# Law
160.516(e)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
Request for Production: A formal request by one party in a legal proceeding for the other party to provide documents relevant to the case. Objection: A formal statement by the receiving party indicating that they cannot comply with the request, along with the reasons for the objection. Motion to Compel: A request made to the administrative law judge (ALJ) to order the opposing party to comply with the document production request. Protective Order: A request to limit or prevent the disclosure of certain documents or information, which can be filed before the production is due.
# Key Legal Principles
Timeliness: The law establishes specific time frames (30 days) for parties to respond to requests and objections, emphasizing the importance of adhering to deadlines in legal procedures. Specification: When objecting to a request, the responding party must specify which parts they object to, ensuring clarity and allowing for targeted resolution of disputes. Rights to Motion: Both parties have rights to file motions (for compelling discovery or protective orders), promoting fairness and the opportunity to seek judicial intervention when necessary.
# Application Scenarios
A party receives a request for production but believes some documents are privileged and cannot be disclosed, leading them to file an objection. The requesting party, unsatisfied with the objections received, decides to file a motion to compel discovery to obtain the documents.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law highlights the procedural framework that ensures both parties in a legal proceeding have the opportunity to present their case effectively by managing document production. It underscores the balance between a party's right to access information and the other party's right to protect sensitive information, contributing to the overall fairness of the legal process.
