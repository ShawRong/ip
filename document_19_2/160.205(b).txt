# Law
160.205(b)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Exception Determination**: This concept refers to a specific allowance or waiver granted under certain conditions outlined in the law, enabling parties to deviate from standard legal requirements. **Revocation of Exception**: This involves the cancellation of the granted exception by the Secretary when the underlying reasons for that exception are no longer applicable.
# Key Legal Principles
**Continuity of Effectiveness**: The principle that an exception remains valid until explicitly revoked, which underscores the importance of the ongoing assessment of the situation that justified the exception. **Discretion of the Secretary**: The principle that grants the Secretary the authority to assess and determine the necessity of exceptions, highlighting the role of administrative discretion in legal processes.
# Application Scenarios
A business granted an exception to environmental regulations might have that exception revoked if they no longer meet the specified conditions for the exception. An organization receiving a waiver for specific compliance issues may face revocation if the justification for the waiver is resolved or eliminated.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provision emphasizes the temporary nature of exceptions, reinforcing the idea that legal compliance is the default state unless otherwise justified. It highlights the importance of regular evaluations of exceptions, promoting accountability and responsiveness in regulatory practices.
