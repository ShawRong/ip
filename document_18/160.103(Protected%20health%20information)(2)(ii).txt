# Law
160.103(Protected%20health%20information)(2)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any health information that can be used to identify an individual and is held by a covered entity or business associate. It is subject to privacy protections under laws such as HIPAA. Individually Identifiable Health Information: This is information that relates to the past, present, or future health of an individual and can be used to identify that individual. It is a subset of health information that is crucial for understanding what constitutes PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
Exclusion of Identifiable Information: The law specifies that certain individually identifiable health information is excluded from the definition of protected health information, which helps clarify the boundaries of what is considered sensitive health data. Compliance with Federal Law: The reference to 20 U.S.C. 1232g(a)(4)(B)(iv) indicates a requirement to align with federal education privacy laws, particularly concerning how student health records are managed.
# Application Scenarios
Healthcare providers must ensure that their handling of health information complies with both HIPAA regulations and relevant federal statutes, particularly when dealing with information related to students. Educational institutions must navigate the complexities of protecting student health information while ensuring compliance with both FERPA and HIPAA, particularly when health services are provided on campus.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between general health information and specifically identifiable health data, reinforcing the need for stringent privacy measures. It supports the overarching legal framework aimed at protecting individual privacy rights while allowing for necessary information sharing in educational and healthcare settings.
