Business Associate: Refers to an entity or person that performs functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity, which involve the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). Protected Health Information (PHI): Any information held by a covered entity that pertains to an individual's health status, provision of healthcare, or payment for healthcare that can be linked to a specific individual.

# Relationship to Overall Document Argument

By defining the role of business associates, the law supports the broader goals of the HIPAA framework, which seeks to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery while safeguarding patient privacy.
