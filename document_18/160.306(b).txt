160.306(b)
# Key Legal Concepts
Written Complaints: Complaints must be submitted in written form, either on paper or electronically, ensuring a formal process for addressing grievances. Identification of the Subject: Complaints must specify the individual or entity being complained about, along with a clear description of the actions or inactions that are alleged to violate administrative provisions. Timeliness: Complaints must be filed within 180 days of the complainant's awareness of the issue, promoting prompt action and resolution of disputes. Discretionary Time Waiver: The Secretary has the authority to waive the 180-day filing limit for good cause, providing flexibility in circumstances where delays may be justified. Procedural Authority: The Secretary can establish additional complaint procedures and guidelines, allowing for adaptive processes that may evolve over time.
# Key Legal Principles
Access to Justice: The requirement for formal written complaints ensures that individuals have a structured means to seek redress and hold parties accountable. Accountability: By necessitating the identification of the subject of the complaint, the law reinforces the principle of accountability among individuals and organizations. Fairness in Filing: The 180-day timeframe and the possibility of waiver reflect a balance between the need for timely complaints and the reality of complex situations that may delay action. Regulatory Flexibility: The authority granted to the Secretary to modify complaint procedures underscores the importance of a responsive regulatory framework.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider receives a complaint about a potential breach of patient privacy and must ensure it is filed in writing, specifying the provider involved and the nature of the alleged breach. A complainant realizes they have been wronged but only discovers this after several months; they must file within the 180-day period unless they can demonstrate good cause for a waiver.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
Section 160.306(b) outlines the necessary steps for filing complaints, which serves as a foundational element in the broader context of administrative simplification and regulatory compliance. The requirements set forth in this section help ensure that complaints are handled systematically, which supports the overall goal of maintaining standards and accountability in administrative practices.
