# Law
160.420(a)(2)
# Key Legal Concepts
Notice Requirement: The law mandates that respondents receive written notice of any proposed penalties, ensuring they are informed of potential repercussions. Findings of Fact: The law requires a clear description of the factual basis for the proposed penalty, which promotes transparency and fairness in administrative actions. Statistical Sampling: The use of statistical sampling as a basis for imposing penalties introduces a methodical approach to assessing violations, allowing for broader conclusions based on a subset of data.
# Key Legal Principles
Due Process: Providing notice and an explanation of findings upholds the principle of due process, ensuring respondents have the opportunity to understand and challenge the proposed penalties. Accountability: The requirement for the Secretary to supply a description of violations fosters accountability in the enforcement of regulations. Evidence-Based Decision Making: The necessity to provide a copy of the statistical sampling study when used reinforces the principle of evidence-based decision-making in regulatory enforcement.
# Application Scenarios
A company receives a notice of a proposed penalty based on statistical sampling of its compliance records, prompting it to review the findings and prepare a response. An individual facing a penalty can use the notice to understand the specific violations and challenge the Secretary's conclusions based on the provided findings.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law strengthens the regulatory framework by ensuring that penalties are not arbitrary but are grounded in documented findings, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of enforcement actions. It aligns with overarching principles of fairness and transparency in administrative law, reinforcing the idea that respondents should have access to the basis for regulatory actions taken against them.
