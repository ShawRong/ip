# Law
164.104(a)
# Key Legal Concepts
The term 'health plan' refers to any plan that provides, or pays for the cost of, medical care. This includes private health insurance and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. A 'health care clearinghouse' is an entity that processes or facilitates the processing of health information received from another entity, often converting it into a standard format for further processing. A 'health care provider' is defined as an individual or organization that provides medical services and transmits health information electronically in connection with covered transactions.
# Key Legal Principles
The principle of applicability indicates that specific standards and implementation specifications must be adhered to by designated entities, ensuring uniformity and compliance in health care transactions. The principle of electronic transmission emphasizes the importance of proper handling and security of health information when it is shared electronically, which is critical for maintaining patient privacy and data integrity.
# Application Scenarios
A health care provider submitting claims electronically to an insurance company must comply with the standards outlined in this law to ensure that the transmission is secure and meets regulatory requirements. A health care clearinghouse processing patient information must implement appropriate measures to convert and transmit data while adhering to the standards to protect patient confidentiality.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law establishes a framework for which entities must comply with specific standards, thereby promoting consistency in the handling of health information across various platforms. By delineating the responsibilities of health plans, clearinghouses, and providers, this law underpins the broader legal and regulatory environment aimed at protecting patient information and ensuring efficient health care operations.
