# Key Legal Concepts
**Motions**: A formal request made to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) seeking a specific ruling or order. Each motion must clearly state the relief sought, the legal authority supporting it, and the factual basis. **Written and Oral Motions**: Generally, motions must be submitted in writing, with provisions for oral motions to be put in writing if the ALJ requires it. **Response Period**: Parties have a defined period (10 days) to respond to written motions, ensuring that all parties have a chance to present their views before a ruling. **Timing of Motion Decisions**: The ALJ cannot grant a motion until the response period has expired, except in specific circumstances, protecting the rights of all parties involved. **Disposition of Outstanding Motions**: The ALJ is obligated to address all pending motions before the hearing begins, promoting efficiency and clarity in the proceedings.
# Key Legal Principles
**Due Process**: Ensures that all parties have an opportunity to respond to motions, reflecting the principle of fair hearing rights. **Efficiency in Proceedings**: The requirement for the ALJ to resolve outstanding motions before hearings emphasizes the need for organized and timely legal processes. **Authority and Jurisdiction**: Establishes the ALJ's role in managing procedural aspects of the hearing, including the authority to grant or deny motions based on prescribed rules.
# Application Scenarios
A party may file a motion to dismiss a case, outlining the reasons and legal basis for dismissal, which the ALJ must consider before proceeding. A party can file a motion for summary judgment, which requires a response from the opposing party, ensuring that both sides present their arguments before the ALJ makes a ruling.
