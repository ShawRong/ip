Compliance: Adhering to established standards is critical for regulatory compliance and ensuring safety and effectiveness in products and systems. Accountability: Standards create a framework for accountability, ensuring that manufacturers and service providers meet defined criteria.
# Application Scenarios
In product development, standards guide engineers in selecting materials and designing components to ensure safety and functionality. In regulatory compliance, companies must demonstrate that their products meet the established standards to avoid legal penalties and ensure market access.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes the importance of standardized practices in promoting quality and consistency across industries. It supports the idea that clearly defined standards are essential for protecting consumers and fostering trust in products and services.
