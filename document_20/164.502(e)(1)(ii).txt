Subcontractor: A third-party entity engaged by a business associate to perform certain functions that involve handling PHI. Protected Health Information (PHI): Any information that can identify an individual and relates to their health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care.

Flow-Down Requirements: The obligations imposed on business associates regarding PHI must also be transferred to subcontractors, ensuring a consistent level of protection.
# Application Scenarios

A health insurance company (covered entity) collaborates with a third-party analytics firm (business associate) that subcontracts certain data analysis tasks to another vendor.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes the necessity of safeguarding PHI in complex relationships involving multiple parties, reinforcing the importance of due diligence. It highlights the interconnected responsibilities among covered entities, business associates, and subcontractors, ensuring that PHI is protected at all levels of data handling.
