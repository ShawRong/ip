# Law
164.502
# Key Legal Concepts
**Protected Health Information (PHI)**: This refers to any individually identifiable health information that is held by a covered entity or business associate, which can include demographic data, medical histories, and payment information. **Covered Entities and Business Associates**: Covered entities include healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses that transmit PHI. Business associates are entities that perform functions on behalf of or provide services to covered entities that involve the use or disclosure of PHI. **Minimum Necessary Standard**: This principle requires that when using or disclosing PHI, or when requesting PHI from another entity, only the minimum amount of information necessary to achieve the intended purpose should be used or disclosed.
# Key Legal Principles
**Permitted Uses and Disclosures**: Covered entities and business associates may only use or disclose PHI as permitted or required by the law, ensuring that patient privacy is maintained. **Restrictions on Use and Disclosure**: If a covered entity has agreed to certain restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI, it must comply with these restrictions unless otherwise provided in the regulations. **Confidential Communications**: Covered health providers must adhere to specific requirements when communicating PHI, ensuring that patient confidentiality is respected.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider sharing patient information with a specialist must ensure that the information shared is limited to what is necessary for the specialist to provide care. A health plan must obtain explicit consent from a patient before disclosing their health information for marketing purposes, adhering to the notice requirements outlined in the law.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions in ยง 164.502 establish the framework for how PHI can be used and disclosed, balancing the need for information sharing in healthcare with the imperative to protect patient privacy. By enforcing the minimum necessary standard and providing guidelines for disclosures, the law aims to foster trust in the healthcare system, encouraging individuals to seek care without fear of unauthorized information sharing.
