# Law
160.402(b)(1)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entity**: A covered entity refers to organizations or individuals who are subject to the laws outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. **Business Associate**: A business associate is an individual or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). **Joint and Several Liability**: This legal concept means that when multiple parties are responsible for a violation, each can be held liable for the entire amount of damages or penalties, allowing the injured party to pursue any one of them for the full amount.
# Key Legal Principles
**Civil Money Penalties**: The law establishes that civil money penalties can be imposed on covered entities or business associates when they are found responsible for violations of HIPAA regulations. **Determination of Responsibility**: The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to determine whether more than one covered entity or business associate is responsible for a violation, which directly influences the imposition of penalties.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare system with multiple affiliated providers that inadvertently shares patient data in violation of HIPAA may face penalties against each provider if found jointly responsible. A business associate that mishandles protected health information may lead to penalties for both the business associate and the covered entity it serves if both are found responsible for the violation.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This law emphasizes accountability among multiple parties involved in healthcare, reinforcing the need for compliance with HIPAA regulations. The provisions ensure that liability is shared among covered entities and business associates, promoting a culture of diligence and responsibility in protecting patient information.
