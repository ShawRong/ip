# Law
164.502(i)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): Refers to any individually identifiable health information that is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse. Covered Entity: This includes health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. Notice of Privacy Practices: A document required under ยง 164.520 that informs individuals about how their PHI may be used and disclosed, as well as their rights regarding that information.
# Key Legal Principles
Consistency with Notice: Covered entities must ensure that any use or disclosure of PHI is consistent with the privacy practices outlined in their notice. This principle promotes transparency and trust. Opt-Out Rights: Individuals have the right to opt out of certain communications, such as fundraising efforts, which must be clearly stated in the notice. This principle emphasizes individual autonomy and control over personal health information.
# Application Scenarios
A hospital must ensure that its notice of privacy practices explicitly states its policies on fundraising activities before it can contact patients for donations. A health insurance company that wants to share patient information with third-party vendors for marketing purposes must include this intention in its notice to comply with the law.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes the importance of transparency in the handling of PHI, reinforcing the patients' right to be informed about how their data is used. It establishes a framework that protects individuals' privacy rights while allowing covered entities to engage in necessary activities, provided they comply with notification requirements.
