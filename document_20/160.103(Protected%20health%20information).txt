# Law
160.103(Protected%20health%20information)
# Key Legal Concepts
Protected Health Information (PHI): This refers to any health information that can identify an individual, including details like medical history, test results, and treatment information. Individually Identifiable Health Information: This is a subset of PHI that specifically pertains to data that can be linked to a specific individual, making it particularly sensitive.
# Key Legal Principles
Confidentiality: The principle that PHI must be kept private and secure, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to it. Exclusion of Non-Identifiable Data: Health information that cannot be linked to a specific individual is not considered PHI, thus not subject to the same level of regulatory protection.
# Application Scenarios
Healthcare providers must implement safeguards to protect PHI when sharing patient records with insurance companies. Researchers using health data must ensure that the data is de-identified to avoid violations of privacy laws.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The definitions provided in this law establish the framework for understanding what constitutes PHI, which is crucial for enforcing privacy regulations. Clarifying the distinction between identifiable and non-identifiable health information serves to guide compliance efforts and protect individual privacy.
