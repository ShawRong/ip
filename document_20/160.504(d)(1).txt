# Key Legal Concepts
Timeliness of Hearing Requests: This concept refers to the requirement that requests for hearings must be filed within a specific timeframe as stipulated in the relevant regulations. Response Requirements: This involves the obligation of the respondent to clearly address each finding of fact in their hearing request, either admitting, denying, or explaining their knowledge of those findings.
# Key Legal Principles
Due Process: The principle that respondents must be given an opportunity to contest findings against them in a fair manner, which includes timely filing of requests and adequate responses. Affirmative Defense: The recognition that a respondent can introduce certain defenses at any time, emphasizing the flexibility within the legal process to allow for late defenses under specific conditions.
# Application Scenarios

A respondent submits a hearing request that does not adequately address the findings of fact, prompting the ALJ to determine that the request does not meet the necessary requirements.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
