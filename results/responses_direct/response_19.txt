In this case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits Spring Harbor Hospital to disclose the requested information in response to the federal grand jury subpoena, even without patient consent. 

Under HIPAA, covered entities like Spring Harbor Hospital are generally required to protect patient privacy. However, there are exceptions that allow for the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without patient consent, particularly when required by law. The subpoena from the federal grand jury constitutes a legal demand for information, which falls under this exception.

The hospital must ensure that the information disclosed is limited to what is necessary to comply with the subpoena. Additionally, it may want to seek clarification on the scope of the subpoena or consult legal counsel to navigate the complexities of this situation, ensuring that they are fulfilling their legal obligations while still respecting patient privacy to the greatest extent possible.
