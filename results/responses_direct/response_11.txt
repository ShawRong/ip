The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally permits the disclosure of medical records of deceased individuals to specific parties, but it also sets limitations. Under HIPAA, the term "personal representative" is crucial. The rule allows access to a deceased individual's protected health information (PHI) to their personal representative, which is typically defined by state law.

In this case, the nursing facilities denied access to the medical records of deceased residents based on their interpretation of HIPAA regulations, specifically 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.502. They believed that only personal representatives, as defined under HIPAA, could access these records, and the spouses and attorneys-in-fact did not qualify under that definition.

However, Florida law, specifically ยง 400.145, provides broader access to medical records for spouses and certain representatives of deceased individuals. This creates a conflict between state and federal law. The HIPAA Privacy Rule does allow state laws to grant more access than federal regulations, meaning the nursing facilities could potentially have violated Florida law by not complying with the state requirements.

In summary, while HIPAA sets strict guidelines for privacy, it also allows state laws to provide greater access. Therefore, the nursing facilities' denial of access based on their interpretation of HIPAA was not in alignment with Florida law, which requires them to furnish medical records to specific relatives of deceased residents. The case illustrates a conflict where state law supersedes federal law concerning access to medical records in this context.
