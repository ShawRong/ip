To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the specified steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.502(a)(4)(i))

**HIPAA Regulation 164.502(a)(4)(i)** relates to the conditions under which a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) without patient consent. Specifically, it states that a covered entity may disclose PHI if required by law, which includes complying with a subpoena or similar legal process.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, the following points are relevant:

1. **Subpoena Issued by the Grand Jury**: The Effingham County grand jury issued subpoenas for Bauer’s medical records, which included the blood-alcohol test results. Under HIPAA, disclosures made in response to subpoenas are generally permitted as long as they comply with the legal requirements.

2. **No Explicit Consent**: Bauer did not provide explicit consent for his medical information to be disclosed. However, HIPAA allows for the disclosure of PHI without consent when required by law.

3. **Handling of Sensitive Information**: Although the hospital complied with the subpoena, the subsequent handling of the documents by the State’s Attorney raises concerns about whether the information was appropriately safeguarded after disclosure. HIPAA requires that entities ensure that PHI is only used or disclosed for the intended purposes.

4. **Public Safety and Legal Enforcement**: The rationale provided for disclosing the blood-alcohol test results—public safety and legal enforcement—does align with some justifications under HIPAA for disclosing PHI without consent.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the disclosure of Bauer's blood-alcohol test results to the State's Attorney by Carle Foundation Hospital was permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule as it was in response to a lawful subpoena. However, the handling of that information thereafter, particularly in terms of ensuring it was treated as grand jury material, raises potential compliance issues regarding the protection of sensitive health information. 

While the initial disclosure may comply with HIPAA, the subsequent actions surrounding the use of that information could suggest a need for better safeguards to protect patient privacy.
