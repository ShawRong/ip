To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, let's follow the outlined steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs and Their Content

The HIPAA Privacy Rule, codified under 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, establishes standards for the protection of individuals' medical records and personal health information. Key components include:

- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: Any individually identifiable health information held by a covered entity.
- **Permitted Uses and Disclosures**: PHI can be disclosed without patient consent for treatment, payment, healthcare operations, or as required by law (which includes legal subpoenas).
- **Minimum Necessary Standard**: Disclosures should adhere to the minimum necessary standard, meaning only the information required to fulfill the purpose should be shared.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, the university subpoenaed Dr. Mezu's medical records to contest her FMLA leave request. The key considerations include:

1. **Subpoena and Legal Requirement**: The requirement for medical records under a legal subpoena falls under the exceptions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, as disclosures are permitted when required by law.

2. **Confidentiality Order**: The court's implementation of a Confidentiality Order is crucial. This order aims to protect Dr. Mezu's privacy by limiting access to her records, which aligns with HIPAA's minimum necessary standard.

3. **Relevance of Medical Records**: The court determined that the records were essential for the legal proceedings regarding the validity of the FMLA leave. This underscores the balancing act between the need for information in legal contexts and the protection of individual privacy rights.

### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the disclosure of Dr. Mezu's medical records under the circumstances described, as the subpoena falls within the legal requirements. Additionally, the court's actions to enforce a Confidentiality Order demonstrate a commitment to mitigating privacy concerns while allowing the discovery process to proceed. Thus, the case appears to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, provided that all disclosures adhere to the stipulated confidentiality measures.
