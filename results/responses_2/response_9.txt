To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the specified steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs

1. **164.508(b)(5)(i)**: This regulation allows a patient to revoke their authorization for the use or disclosure of their protected health information (PHI) at any time, except to the extent that the covered entity has already relied on the authorization to take action.

2. **164.508(a)**: This section outlines the general requirement for obtaining an individual's authorization for the use or disclosure of PHI, stating that it must be in plain language and must explain the purpose of the disclosure.

3. **164.508(a)(2)**: This subsection clarifies that an authorization must be specific to the information to be disclosed and must identify the recipients of the information.

4. **164.508(b)(2)(iii)**: This part indicates that a covered entity may not disclose PHI after an individual has revoked their authorization, provided that the revocation is made in writing and received by the covered entity before the disclosure occurs.

### Step 2: Determine Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule

In this case, Koch initially authorized the SEC to obtain his medical information, which aligns with the requirements of 164.508(a) and 164.508(b)(5)(i). However, he later revoked this authorization before any information was disclosed by his psychoanalyst, Ms. Aron. 

The crucial points to consider are:

- Koch's revocation of authorization was made prior to Ms. Aron being served with a subpoena, which means that no action based on the authorization was taken by the covered entity (the healthcare providers).
- According to regulation 164.508(b)(5)(i) and 164.508(b)(2)(iii), Koch's revocation should prevent any disclosure of his psychotherapy records, as the revocation occurred before the disclosure took place.

Based on the above analysis, it appears that the district court's ruling, which allowed for the disclosure despite the revocation, may not be in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Koch's appeal is justified as his revocation was effective, and he did not provide an express waiver of his psychotherapist-patient privilege after revocation.

### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits Koch's revocation of authorization to stand, thus forbidding the SEC from obtaining his psychotherapy records without his consent after the revocation. The district court's initial ruling does not align with HIPAA regulations, and Koch's appeal is supported by the provisions outlined in the relevant HIPAA regulations.
