To assess the compliance of the described case with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, let's follow the outlined steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs (164.103Requiredbylaw)

The HIPAA regulation ID 164.103 defines "Required by Law" and discusses circumstances under which a covered entity (such as healthcare providers) may disclose protected health information (PHI) without patient consent. Specifically, it states that PHI can be disclosed when required by a law that is enforceable in court, such as court orders, subpoenas, or other legal mandates.

### Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case

In this case, nurse practitioner Drexel Jordan was subpoenaed to testify about James A1 White's HIV status as part of a legal proceeding. Since the court issued a subpoena, this scenario falls under the "Required by Law" provision of HIPAA. 

- **Compliance with HIPAA**: The disclosure of James's HIV status to the court appears to be compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule because:
  - The disclosure was mandated by a subpoena, representing a legal requirement.
  - HIPAA allows for the release of PHI when required by law, which includes court orders or subpoenas.

- **Lack of Consent**: The absence of James's consent for the disclosure does not violate HIPAA in this context, as the Privacy Rule acknowledges that legal obligations can supersede patient consent in certain circumstances.

### Conclusion

The case is compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the legal requirement for disclosure stemming from the subpoena. This situation exemplifies the intersection of healthcare privacy and legal obligations, highlighting that while patient privacy is paramount, the law provides specific exceptions where disclosure is necessary for legal proceedings.
