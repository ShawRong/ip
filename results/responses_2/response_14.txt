To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the outlined steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs

The regulation ID **164.502(a)(5)(ii)(B)(2)(iii)** pertains to the conditions under which a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) without patient authorization for legal proceedings. This section focuses on the following key points:

- A covered entity may disclose PHI in the course of judicial and administrative proceedings.
- The disclosure must comply with applicable legal requirements for the release of such information.
- Patients' rights to their information must be considered, and safeguards should be in place to protect their privacy.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, Eli Lilly & Company is seeking access to medical records of Medicaid patients prescribed Zyprexa to support its legal defense against claims regarding unlawful marketing practices. 

1. **Legal Context**: The request for medical records falls under the provisions that allow for the disclosure of PHI for litigation purposes. Specifically, if the states are acting as covered entities (which they are, as Medicaid agencies) and if they comply with the necessary legal standards, they may be permitted to disclose the requested information.

2. **Patient Privacy Considerations**: The states have valid concerns regarding patient privacy and the relevance of the requested records. They argue that the records are protected under physician-patient privilege and that their relevance to the case is questionable. HIPAA emphasizes the importance of safeguarding patient information, and any disclosure must ensure that patient privacy is not unduly compromised.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: If the states decide to disclose the records, they must ensure that:
   - The disclosure aligns with applicable legal requirements.
   - Proper safeguards are in place to protect the identity of patients, possibly through de-identification of data.

### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule does permit the disclosure of medical records in the context of legal proceedings, provided that the necessary legal and regulatory criteria are met. However, the states must carefully weigh the privacy implications against the legal obligations to disclose. Thus, while the HIPAA Privacy Rule allows for such disclosure, it also imposes significant responsibilities on the states to protect patient information throughout the process. The ultimate decision will likely hinge on the court's evaluation of relevance and the adequacy of privacy protections in place.
