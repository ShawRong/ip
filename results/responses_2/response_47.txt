### Assessment of Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule

#### Step 1: Review of HIPAA Regulation ID 164.502(g)(5)(ii)

HIPAA regulation 164.502(g)(5)(ii) pertains to the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) when it is compiled for use in legal proceedings. Specifically, it states that a covered entity may deny an individual's request for access to their PHI if the information is being maintained for the purpose of a legal proceeding.

#### Step 2: Determination of Permissibility Under HIPAA

In the case of Dustin J. Merryfield, his request for access to his medical and treatment records was denied by the hospital, citing that the records were compiled in anticipation of legal proceedings. This rationale aligns with the stipulations outlined in 164.502(g)(5)(ii), which permits the withholding of PHI in such circumstances. 

Merryfield's confinement under the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator Act adds a layer of complexity, as it involves both legal and public safety considerations. While he asserts a right to access his medical records, the hospital's decision to deny that access appears to be compliant with HIPAA regulations, given the context of the records being part of ongoing legal processes.

#### Conclusion

Based on the assessment of HIPAA regulation 164.502(g)(5)(ii) and the facts of the case, the hospital's actions in denying Merryfield's request for access to his medical records are permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The regulation allows for such disclosures to be withheld when related to legal proceedings, which is the basis for the hospital's justification in this instance.
