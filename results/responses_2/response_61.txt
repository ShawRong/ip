To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the specified steps:

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs

**HIPAA Regulation 164.510(a)(3)(i)** states that a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) without the individual’s consent to law enforcement if the disclosure is required by law, such as through a subpoena.

**HIPAA Regulation 164.510(a)(3)** allows for disclosures of PHI for law enforcement purposes under specific conditions, including:
- The individual is a victim of a crime, and the covered entity is unable to obtain consent due to the victim’s incapacity.
- The disclosure is necessary to alert law enforcement to the commission of a crime.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In the case provided:

1. **Nature of the Disclosure**: Kennemur's medical records and blood alcohol test results were requested by law enforcement via a subpoena for purposes related to an intoxication manslaughter charge.

2. **Absence of Consent**: The disclosure was made without Kennemur's consent, which raises concerns under HIPAA. However, the subpoena serves as a legal requirement for the disclosure.

3. **Justification for Disclosure**: The information was deemed necessary to establish a link between Kennemur's intoxication and the fatal accident. This aligns with the conditions outlined in HIPAA, as the disclosure was required by law and essential for law enforcement's investigation.

### Conclusion

Based on the regulations, the disclosure of Kennemur's PHI to law enforcement was permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule due to the issuance of a subpoena and the necessity of the information for a criminal investigation. Therefore, the case complies with HIPAA, as it involved a lawful request for information pertinent to a crime, even in the absence of Kennemur's consent.
