To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the specified steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs (160.202) and Their Content

HIPAA regulation 160.202 pertains to definitions related to the Privacy Rule, specifically defining terms such as "protected health information" (PHI) and "personal representative." Under 45 C.F.R. § 164.502, the regulation outlines the general rules for the use and disclosure of PHI, specifically indicating that a covered entity may not disclose PHI without authorization unless certain exceptions apply.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, the nursing facilities denied requests for access to the medical records of deceased residents based on their interpretation of HIPAA, believing that only "personal representatives" could access such information. Under HIPAA, a "personal representative" is defined as someone who has the authority to act on behalf of the individual in making healthcare decisions.

However, the situation is complicated by Florida law, which requires nursing homes to provide access to medical records to the spouse, guardian, surrogate, or attorney-in-fact of a deceased resident. This state law grants broader access to medical records than what HIPAA permits.

#### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not explicitly forbid access to the medical records of deceased individuals by their spouses or attorneys-in-fact, but it does restrict access to those designated as personal representatives. In this scenario, the nursing facilities’ refusal to provide access based on their interpretation of HIPAA may lead to non-compliance with Florida law, which mandates access. 

Thus, the facilities face a conflict between compliance with federal HIPAA regulations and state law. They should seek legal counsel to navigate this conflict and potentially revise their policies to align with state requirements while ensuring they adequately protect patient privacy as mandated by federal law. 

In summary, the nursing facilities' strict adherence to HIPAA may not be justifiable if it results in violation of Florida law, highlighting the importance of understanding both federal and state regulations in healthcare compliance.
