To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule based on the provided scenario, we will follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs

The specific regulation mentioned, **164.504(e)(4)(ii)(B)**, pertains to the conditions under which a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) to a business associate. This regulation requires that a written agreement (Business Associate Agreement) be in place between the covered entity and the business associate, detailing the permitted uses and disclosures of PHI and ensuring that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information.

#### Key Points from 164.504(e)(4)(ii)(B):
- Disclosure of PHI to business associates is allowed under certain conditions.
- A written agreement must outline the responsibilities of the business associate concerning the protection of PHI.
- The business associate is required to implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to PHI.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In the presented case, several key factors indicate a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

1. **Unauthorized Access**: An employee of Intermedix accessed PHI without authorization. This directly contravenes the requirement for safeguarding PHI as mandated by the HIPAA regulations.

2. **Data Breach**: The fact that sensitive information was not only accessed improperly but also shared with unauthorized third parties for illicit activities constitutes a significant breach of confidentiality and trust, violating HIPAA's protections.

3. **Lack of Safeguards**: The case implies that appropriate safeguards may not have been in place to protect the PHI as required by 164.504(e)(4)(ii)(B). If the business associate (Intermedix) failed to implement necessary security measures, this would further indicate non-compliance with HIPAA.

4. **Legal Action**: The affected individualâ€™s decision to take legal action reflects a broader concern for the mishandling of PHI. This legal response highlights the seriousness of the breach and the impact on the individuals whose data was compromised.

### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the actions taken by the defendants in this case. The unauthorized access and subsequent misuse of protected health information illustrate a clear violation of the HIPAA regulations governing the handling of PHI. The failure to safeguard this information and to comply with the requirements of a Business Associate Agreement constitutes a breach of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. As such, the defendants may be held accountable for these violations and the resulting harm to the affected individuals.
