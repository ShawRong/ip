To assess Mr. Patrick N. Sweeney's case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the specified steps.

### Step 1: Review HIPAA Regulation ID 164.502(g)(5)(ii)

The HIPAA Privacy Rule, specifically regulation ID 164.502(g)(5)(ii), pertains to the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) in certain circumstances. It allows covered entities to disclose PHI without patient consent for specific purposes related to the legal or administrative proceedings. Particularly, it addresses situations involving fitness-for-duty assessments and the need to ensure that an employee can safely perform their job, especially when public safety is a concern.

### Step 2: Determine the Compliance of the Case

In Mr. Sweeney's case, the following points are critical:

1. **Employer's Authority**: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requested Mr. Sweeney to sign an Authorization for the Release of Medical Records as part of a fitness-for-duty examination. This is a standard procedure when evaluating an employee's ability to safely perform their duties, especially in roles involving public safety.

2. **Public Safety Concerns**: Given the previous concerns about Mr. Sweeney's conduct and the implications for public safety, the DHS's request is justified under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The rule allows for the disclosure of PHI when necessary to protect public safety and ensure the employee is fit for duty.

3. **Patient Rights vs. Employer Needs**: Mr. Sweeney's refusal to consent to the release of his medical records, while rooted in his interpretation of privacy rights, does not override the employer's obligation to assess fitness for duty in this specific context. The employer's right to access relevant medical information in light of public safety concerns takes precedence.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation of regulation ID 164.502(g)(5)(ii) and the circumstances surrounding Mr. Sweeney's case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule **permits** the actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security in requesting the release of medical records for the fitness-for-duty examination. Mr. Sweeney's refusal to comply does not align with the requirements set forth in the regulation, particularly given the significant safety implications involved.
