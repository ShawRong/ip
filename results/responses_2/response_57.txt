To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation IDs

The relevant regulation IDs under the HIPAA Privacy Rule include:

- **45 CFR ยง164.502**: This section outlines the general rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI).
- **45 CFR ยง164.512**: This section specifies circumstances under which PHI may be disclosed without patient consent, including disclosures required by law.

### Content Review

- **Protected Health Information (PHI)**: The Appellee's medical records, including the blood alcohol test results, constitute PHI.
- **Disclosure Without Consent**: The case describes a situation where medical records were disclosed to law enforcement pursuant to a grand jury subpoena.

### Step 2: Determine Permissibility Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule

According to **45 CFR ยง164.512**:

- A covered entity (like Covenant Medical Center) may disclose PHI without the individual's consent when required by law. This includes compliance with subpoenas, provided that the subpoena is valid and appropriate for obtaining medical records.

### Analysis of the Case

1. **Subpoena Validity**: The Assistant District Attorney filed a grand jury subpoena for the Appellee's medical records. As the subpoena was executed, it indicates a legal requirement was in place.
   
2. **Compliance Without Consent**: The hospital complied with the subpoena and provided the medical records to the District Attorney's office. Since the subpoena was a legal instrument, the hospital's disclosure of the PHI was permissible under HIPAA.

3. **Legal Context**: The actions taken were part of a criminal investigation into driving while intoxicated, which often necessitates the use of such medical information.

### Conclusion

The case appears to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The disclosure of the Appellee's medical records to law enforcement was permitted because it was done in response to a legal subpoena, thereby falling within the exceptions outlined in the HIPAA regulations. The lack of patient consent does not violate HIPAA in this scenario due to the legal requirements of the subpoena.
