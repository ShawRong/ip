To assess the case for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA regulation IDs (164.504(f)(2)(ii)(B)) and their content.

**HIPAA Regulation 164.504(f)(2)(ii)(B)** pertains to the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by a covered entity to a business associate or for health oversight activities. The relevant content states that a covered entity may disclose PHI without patient consent to a health oversight agency, but only if the disclosure is necessary for oversight activities authorized by law.

### Step 2: Determine whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits or forbids the case.

In this case, the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) is acting as a health oversight agency, which is permitted under HIPAA to access PHI without patient consent when necessary for oversight activities. However, several critical factors must be assessed:

1. **Purpose of Disclosure**: The OIG's stated purposes—investigating criminal misconduct and assessing eligibility for benefits—may fall under the permissible scope of health oversight activities. However, the justification must be clearly aligned with oversight functions and not broader than necessary.

2. **Knowledge and Consent**: The lack of knowledge and consent from the employees raises significant privacy concerns. HIPAA does allow for certain disclosures without consent, but the individuals whose information is being accessed should ideally be informed about the nature of these disclosures, especially when it pertains to sensitive health information.

3. **Necessity of the Disclosure**: It must be determined whether the OIG's access to the medical records was genuinely necessary for their oversight activities. The regulation requires that disclosures be limited to the minimum necessary information needed to achieve the intended purpose.

4. **Constitutionality and Legal Challenges**: The actions of the OIG have been challenged by unions, which raises questions about the legality and potential overreach of the OIG's authority. If the unions can prove that the OIG’s practices violate not only HIPAA but also constitutional rights, this could further complicate the legality of the disclosures.

### Conclusion

While the HIPAA Privacy Rule does permit disclosures to health oversight agencies without patient consent, the specific circumstances of this case introduce significant concerns regarding patient awareness, consent, and the necessity of the information being accessed. The actions of the OIG may be in violation of the spirit of HIPAA, particularly regarding the rights of individuals to have their health information kept private. 

Therefore, while technically permissible under certain conditions, the OIG's practice in this case appears to conflict with the intent of HIPAA's privacy protections, warranting further examination and potential legal action.
