To assess the case of Ella Ussery for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the steps outlined in the instruction.

### Step 1: Review HIPAA Regulation IDs

#### Regulation ID: 164.502(g)(3)(ii)(C)
This regulation pertains to the conditions under which a covered entity may share protected health information (PHI) with family members or other individuals involved in the care of the patient. Specifically, it allows for disclosure if the patient is incapacitated and the information is relevant to the person’s involvement in the patient’s care.

#### Regulation ID: 164.502(g)(3)(i)(A)
This regulation allows for the disclosure of PHI when it is necessary to provide treatment to the patient. It includes sharing information among healthcare providers involved in the patient's care.

### Step 2: Determine Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule

In the case of Ella Ussery, the medical professionals, including Dr. Jose, communicated with her parents about her health condition and prognosis. This communication involved sharing medical information directly relevant to Ella’s care and treatment.

1. **Involvement of Family Members**: Since Ella was incapacitated following her surgery and subsequent complications, her parents were appropriately involved in discussions regarding her health status. Under regulation 164.502(g)(3)(ii)(C), this disclosure of information to her parents is permissible, as they were involved in her care and decision-making process.

2. **Treatment Discussions**: The discussions that took place regarding Ella's prognosis and the decision to withdraw life support fall under regulation 164.502(g)(3)(i)(A). The healthcare providers were sharing necessary medical information for the purpose of treatment and care decisions, which is compliant with HIPAA.

### Conclusion

The disclosures made by the medical professionals to Ella's parents were appropriate and in line with the regulations, as they involved necessary communication regarding her treatment and prognosis while respecting the privacy of the patient.
