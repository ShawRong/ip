### Response:
The action taken by Sherri Smith in modifying the medical authorization form to limit the disclosure strictly to "medical records and bills," explicitly excluding any private interviews with healthcare providers, is **Permitted** under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Sherri's decision to protect her daughter's privacy by setting clear boundaries and explicitly stating her wishes aligns with the patient's rights to control the disclosure of their medical information under the Privacy Rule.
