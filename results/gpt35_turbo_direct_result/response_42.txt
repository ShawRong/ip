### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the disclosure of the medical files of the three train crew members in this case. Union Pacific's objection to the request citing concerns over violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other medical privacy laws is valid. The request for these medical files was deemed overly broad and sought private and confidential information irrelevant to the case at hand. The protection of individual privacy rights under HIPAA takes precedence in this situation, balancing the need for legal discovery with the imperative of safeguarding private health information.
