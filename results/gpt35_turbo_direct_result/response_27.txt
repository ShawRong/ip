### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of Esther A. Broderick's medical records in this case. Since there was no consent provided by Broderick or a legally authorized representative for this disclosure, and the request pertains to sensitive medical information related to mental health, the Privacy Rule prohibits the disclosure of such information without proper authorization.
