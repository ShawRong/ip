The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Permits** the sharing of private medical information in this case. Dorothy Shanks legally consented to the disclosure of her medical records, which was crucial for the legal proceedings. The information shared by her prosthetist was directly relevant to the disability discrimination claim against Sony and was deemed essential for understanding her physical capabilities and limitations. Additionally, the disclosure was necessary to determine the impact of her amputation on her job performance and to assess the legitimacy of the discrimination allegations.
