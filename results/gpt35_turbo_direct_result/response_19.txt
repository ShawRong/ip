Based on the provided case, the HIPAA Privacy Rule forbids the disclosure of patient information in this scenario. The subpoena demanding disclosure of a patient's mental health history without the patient's consent does not align with the typical requirements for sharing sensitive health information. While the hospital may feel pressured to comply with the federal investigation, the HIPAA Privacy Rule prioritizes patient confidentiality and requires explicit consent for such disclosures. In this case, the hospital should carefully consider the legal and ethical implications before sharing any confidential patient information.
