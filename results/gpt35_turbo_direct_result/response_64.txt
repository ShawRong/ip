### Response:
The HIPAA Privacy Rule **forbids** the actions described in the case. The disclosure of the patient's prescription records to law enforcement without their consent or a warrant goes against the privacy protections outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. While state laws may require pharmacies to provide such records to law enforcement under certain circumstances, HIPAA generally requires patient authorization or a valid legal process, such as a warrant, for the release of protected health information for purposes not related to treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. The situation described raises significant concerns regarding patient privacy and the handling of sensitive health information without proper safeguards.
