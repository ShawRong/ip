### Response: Forbid

The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally forbids the disclosure of protected health information (PHI) without patient authorization. In the described case, the defendants' request to obtain the medical records of the plaintiffs from their treating physicians would likely not be permitted under HIPAA regulations unless specific conditions for disclosure were met, such as obtaining appropriate patient authorizations. Given the sensitivity of medical information and the need to protect patient privacy, accessing PHI in this manner without explicit consent from the plaintiffs would likely be considered a violation of HIPAA regulations.
