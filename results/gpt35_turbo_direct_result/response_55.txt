### Response: **Forbid**

The HIPAA Privacy Rule generally forbids the disclosure of an individual's protected health information without their explicit consent. In this case, the disclosure of Christopher J. Bauer's serum-alcohol-concentration test results to the State's Attorney and the grand jury without his consent raises significant concerns regarding medical privacy violations. Despite the intentions to gather evidence for DUI charges, the disclosure of this sensitive information without proper authorization goes against the privacy protections established by HIPAA.
