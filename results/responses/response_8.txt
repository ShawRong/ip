To assess the case of Mr. Patrick N. Sweeney in relation to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, we will follow the steps outlined in the instruction.

### Step 1: Check the HIPAA Regulation ID 164.502(g)(5)(ii)

The regulation 45 CFR 164.502(g)(5)(ii) pertains to the conditions under which a covered entity may disclose protected health information (PHI) without an individual’s authorization. Specifically, it allows for such disclosures in the context of a fitness-for-duty examination when the employer has a legitimate reason to evaluate the employee’s ability to perform their job safely.

### Step 2: Determine Whether the HIPAA Privacy Rule Permits or Forbids the Case

In this case, Mr. Sweeney's employer, the Department of Homeland Security, requested the release of his medical records to conduct a fitness-for-duty examination. This request is standard procedure when there are concerns about an employee's conduct that could affect public safety, particularly in roles involving firearms.

- **Permitted Disclosure**: Under HIPAA, the employer’s request for medical records for the purpose of evaluating Mr. Sweeney’s fitness for duty aligns with the conditions set forth in 164.502(g)(5)(ii). The employer has a legitimate interest in ensuring that Mr. Sweeney can safely perform his duties, especially given the prior concerns about his conduct.

- **Refusal of Consent**: Mr. Sweeney’s refusal to consent to the release of his medical records, while rooted in his belief about his privacy rights, does not negate the employer's authority to request this information under HIPAA guidelines. The employer can proceed with the evaluation based on available information even if Mr. Sweeney does not provide his authorization.

### Conclusion

The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the Department of Homeland Security to request Mr. Sweeney's medical records for the purpose of a fitness-for-duty examination. The actions taken by the Department appear to comply with HIPAA regulations, and Mr. Sweeney's refusal does not constitute a legal basis for denying the employer's request in this context. Thus, the case aligns with HIPAA provisions, allowing the disclosure of medical records under the circumstances described.
