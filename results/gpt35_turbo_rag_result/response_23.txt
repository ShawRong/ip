### Response:
1. **HIPAA Regulation IDs and Content Checked:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164) was reviewed for compliance.
   
2. **Determination:**
   - The HIPAA Privacy Rule **Forbids** the disclosure of A.M.'s medical information without her explicit consent in this case.

3. **Explanation:**
   - In this scenario, A.M. initially provided consent for the release of her medical information to the investigator, Douglas Bernard. However, when she revoked this consent and started avoiding engagement, the investigator faced challenges in obtaining further information. A.M.'s refusal to grant consent to her attorney to disclose information also indicates her lack of willingness to share her private information.
   
   - Given the sensitive nature of A.M.'s case, especially considering her medical conditions like dementia and hypertension, the HIPAA Privacy Rule emphasizes the protection of individuals' health information, ensuring their privacy rights are respected. Without explicit consent or a legal basis for disclosure, sharing A.M.'s medical details would violate her privacy rights under HIPAA regulations.
