    - **Content Analysis**:
        - Koch revoked his authorization before information was disclosed, invoking his rights under 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.508(b)(5)(I).
        - The district court's ruling on implied waiver contradicted HIPAA's privacy protections.
        - Koch's appeal highlighted the importance of explicit consent and the right to revoke authorization.

2. **Determining Compliance**:
    - **Decision**: **Forbid**
    - **Reasoning**: The case does not violate the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Koch's actions align with his rights to revoke authorization under HIPAA regulations. The initial ruling on implied waiver was inconsistent with HIPAA's intent to protect patient confidentiality.

This assessment indicates that the case involving Randolph Koch and the SEC maintains compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, particularly regarding the revocation of consent for the disclosure of private health information.
