The case involving State Farm, the physicians, and associated entities alleging fraudulent medical practices raises significant concerns regarding the disclosure of private medical information without explicit patient consent. The broad and burdensome nature of the subpoenas issued to non-party law firms, demanding sensitive medical records dating back to 2004, poses potential violations of privacy rights protected by the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Given the circumstances outlined in the case, the disclosure of such extensive medical information without patient consent and in the absence of clear establishment of applicable privileges or undue burden likely goes against the provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. Therefore, the case would likely be forbidden under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
