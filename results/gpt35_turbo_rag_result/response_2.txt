Explanation:
The case described involving the Protection & Advocacy System, Inc. (P & A) in Wyoming aligns with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. P & A's access to health records from the Wyoming State Hospital and Wyoming State Training School is permissible under HIPAA as it falls under the category of health oversight activities. Given the circumstances of investigating potential abuse or neglect in vulnerable populations, including those unable to provide consent, the actions of P & A are authorized and mandated by law to ensure the protection and advocacy of patients' rights. The flow of information between the facilities and P & A is carefully managed to comply with both federal mandates and privacy regulations, making this case compliant with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
