Based on the provided case and the steps outlined, let's assess the compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule:

### Step 1:
The relevant HIPAA regulation IDs mentioned in the case are 164.502(j)(1)(ii) and 164.103.

### Step 2:
Considering the case where the plaintiff's legal team requested the identity of the deceased's roommate from LTC for the purpose of a malpractice case, it appears that this disclosure of protected health information was done through a formal legal process as part of a motion to compel discovery. The court allowed the disclosure under a strict "qualified protective order" solely for litigation purposes.

### Step 3:
Given the circumstances and the legal process involved, in this specific case, the disclosure of the roommate's information was permitted under a strict "qualified protective order" by the court.

Therefore, the assessment for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule in this case would lead to the conclusion that the disclosure of the roommate's information was permitted under the mentioned conditions.
