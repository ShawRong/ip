# Law
160.412
# Key Legal Concepts
**Civil Money Penalty (CMP)**: A financial penalty imposed for violations of certain laws or regulations, intended to deter non-compliance and promote adherence to legal standards. **Waiver of Penalty**: The ability of the Secretary to reduce or eliminate a civil money penalty if it is deemed excessive in relation to the violation.
# Key Legal Principles
**Proportionality Principle**: The civil money penalty must be proportionate to the severity of the violation; excessive penalties may be waived to ensure fairness. **Discretionary Authority**: The Secretary has the discretion to waive penalties, highlighting the importance of context in enforcement actions.
# Application Scenarios
An entity fails to correct a minor violation within the specified timeframe; the Secretary may decide that the penalty would be disproportionate to the nature of the violation. A healthcare provider faces a CMP for a technical breach but demonstrates that the financial impact of the penalty would be debilitating; the Secretary may waive or reduce the penalty.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The provisions for waiving penalties demonstrate a balanced approach to enforcement, allowing for flexibility based on individual circumstances. By including waiver provisions, the law acknowledges that not all violations warrant the same level of financial consequence, promoting fairness in civil enforcement.
