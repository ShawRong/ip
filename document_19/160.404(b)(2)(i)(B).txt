# Law
160.404(b)(2)(i)(B)
# Key Legal Concepts
**Covered Entity**: A covered entity refers to organizations that handle protected health information (PHI) under regulations such as HIPAA. This includes healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. **Business Associate**: A business associate is a person or entity that performs functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of PHI.
# Key Legal Principles
**Reasonable Diligence**: This principle requires that covered entities and business associates take necessary steps to understand their compliance obligations and prevent violations. If a violation occurs and it is established that the entity did not know and could not have known about the violation despite exercising reasonable diligence, this may affect the penalties imposed. **Tiered Penalties**: This principle outlines that penalties for violations can vary based on the level of knowledge and intent of the entity. The section mentions a specific penalty amount for repeated or identical violations, indicating a structured approach to enforcement.
# Application Scenarios
A healthcare provider that inadvertently fails to secure patient records may argue that they exercised reasonable diligence by implementing security measures, thus affecting the severity of penalties. A business associate that wrongly discloses PHI but can demonstrate they were unaware of the regulations may seek to mitigate penalties based on the concept of reasonable diligence.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
The law emphasizes accountability for repeated violations, aiming to deter entities from neglecting compliance obligations by imposing substantial penalties for identical violations within a calendar year. The stipulation for penalties based on knowledge and diligence reinforces the importance of proactive compliance efforts, encouraging entities to maintain robust compliance programs to avoid severe financial repercussions.
