# Law
160.204(a)(3)
# Key Legal Concepts
Preemption: This refers to the principle that federal law overrides state law when both govern the same subject matter, unless a state law is explicitly excepted from preemption. Request for Exception: This is the formal procedure through which a state can seek to exempt a specific provision of state law from being preempted by federal law.
# Key Legal Principles
Written Request Requirement: The law mandates that requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing, ensuring a formal record of the request. Chief Elected Official Submission: The requirement that requests must come from the state's chief elected official or their designee emphasizes the importance of authority and accountability in the process.
# Application Scenarios
A state might submit a request to exempt a public health regulation from federal preemption if it believes that the regulation is crucial for local welfare. A state could also seek an exception for environmental regulations that may conflict with federal standards but are deemed necessary for state-specific ecological conditions.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
This provision underscores the procedural framework within which states can navigate federal preemption, illustrating the balance of power between state and federal laws. The emphasis on documentation and authoritative submission highlights the structured approach to exceptions, reinforcing the legitimacy of state claims against federal standards.
