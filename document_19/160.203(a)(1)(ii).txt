160.203(a)(1)(ii)
# Key Legal Concepts
State Regulation: This concept refers to the authority of state governments to create and enforce laws regarding insurance and health plans, ensuring that such entities operate within a framework that protects consumers and maintains market stability. Express Authorization: This principle indicates that state regulations must be explicitly allowed by existing statutes or regulations, meaning there must be clear legislative intent or authority for the state to impose regulations on insurance and health plans.
# Key Legal Principles
Necessity of Regulation: The principle underscores that regulation is necessary to protect public interest, ensure fair practices, and maintain the integrity of the insurance and health care markets. Compliance with Statutory Framework: This principle emphasizes the need for any regulatory actions taken by the state to be in alignment with existing laws, ensuring that regulations do not exceed the powers granted by the legislature.
# Application Scenarios
Regulating premium rates for health insurance plans to ensure they are fair and affordable for consumers, based on state laws that govern insurance pricing. Establishing minimum coverage requirements for health plans offered within the state, ensuring that all plans provide a baseline of essential health services as permitted by state regulations.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
By emphasizing the necessity of state regulation, the law supports the argument that consumer protection and market stability are paramount in the insurance and health plan sectors. The focus on express authorization reinforces the idea that regulatory actions must be rooted in statutory authority, which is crucial for maintaining lawful governance and preventing overreach by state regulators.
