**Business Associate**: A business associate is defined as a person or entity that performs functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI). This relationship is critical in ensuring that PHI is handled appropriately and securely. **Covered Entity**: This term refers to health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a HIPAA transaction. The relationship between covered entities and business associates is regulated to protect patient information.

A consulting firm that provides data analysis services to a healthcare organization and requires access to patient records to perform its duties acts as a business associate.
