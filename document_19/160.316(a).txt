A patient reports discriminatory practices by a healthcare provider and files a complaint, confident that the provider cannot retaliate against them as per the non-retaliation clause.
# Relationship to Overall Document Argument
ยง 160.316(a) reinforces the importance of filing complaints as a means to uphold rights and ensure compliance with laws governing the conduct of covered entities.
